china	beijing	Forbidden City	Ringed by a 52m-wide moat at the very heart of Běijīng, the Forbidden City is China’s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings, and the largest palace complex in the world. So called because it was off limits for 500 years, when it was steeped in stultifying ritual and Byzantine regal protocol, the otherworldly palace was the reclusive home to two dynasties of imperial rule until the Republic overthrew the last Qing emperor.Today, the Forbidden City is prosaically known as the Palace Museum (故宫博物馆; Gùgōng Bówùguǎn), although most Chinese people simply call it Gù Gōng (故宫; ancient palace).In former ages the price for uninvited admission was instant execution; these days ¥40 or ¥60 will do. Allow yourself the best part of a day for exploration or several trips if you’re an enthusiast.Guides – many with mechanical English – mill about the entrance, but the automatically activated audio tours are cheaper (¥40; more than 40 languages) and more reliable. Restaurants, a cafe, toilets and even ATMs can be found within the palace grounds. Wheelchairs (¥500 deposit) are free to use, as are pushchairs/strollers (¥300 deposit).EntranceTourists must enter through Meridian Gate , a massive U-shaped portal at the south end of the complex, which in former times was reserved for the use of the emperor. Gongs and bells would sound imperial comings and goings, while lesser mortals used lesser gates: the military used the west gate, civilians the east gate. The emperor also reviewed his armies from here, passed judgement on prisoners, announced the new year’s calendar and oversaw the flogging of troublesome ministers.Through Meridian Gate, you enter an enormous courtyard, and cross the Golden Stream (金水; Jīn Shuǐ) – shaped to resemble a Tartar bow and spanned by five marble bridges – on your way to the magnificent Gate of Supreme Harmony . This courtyard could hold an imperial audience of 100,000 people. For an idea of the size of the restoration challenge, note how the crumbling courtyard stones are stuffed with dry weeds, especially on the periphery.First Side GalleriesBefore you pass through the Gate of Supreme Harmony to reach the Forbidden City’s star attractions, veer off to the east and west of the huge courtyard to visit the Calligraphy and Painting Gallery inside the Hall of Martial Valor and the particularly good Ceramics Gallery, housed inside the creaking Hall of Literary Glory .Three Great HallsRaised on a three-tier marble terrace with balustrades are the Three Great Halls, the glorious heart of the Forbidden City. The recently restored Hall of Supreme Harmony is the most important and largest structure in the Forbidden City. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, it was used for ceremonial occasions, such as the emperor’s birthday, the nomination of military leaders and coronations. Inside the Hall of Supreme Harmony is a richly decorated Dragon Throne (龙椅; Lóngyǐ), from which the emperor would preside over trembling officials. The entire court had to touch the floor nine times with their foreheads (the custom known as kowtowing) in the emperor’s presence. At the back of the throne is a carved Xumishan, the Buddhist paradise, signifying the throne’s supremacy.Behind the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the smaller Hall of Middle Harmony , which was used as the emperor’s transit lounge. Here he would make last-minute preparations, rehearse speeches and receive close ministers. On display are two Qing-dynasty sedan chairs, the emperor’s mode of transport around the Forbidden City. The last of the Qing emperors, Puyi, used a bicycle and altered a few features of the palace grounds to make it easier to get around.The third of the Great Halls is the Hall of Preserving Harmony , used for banquets and later for imperial examinations. The hall has no support pillars. To its rear is a 250-tonne marble imperial carriageway carved with dragons and clouds, which was transported into Běijīng on an ice path. The emperor used to be carried over this carriageway in his sedan chair as he ascended or descended the terrace. The outer housing surrounding the Three Great Halls was used for storing gold, silver, silks, carpets and other treasures.A string of side halls on the eastern and western flanks of the Three Great Halls usually, but not always, house a series of excellent exhibitions, ranging from scientific instruments and articles of daily use to objects presented to the emperor by visiting dignitaries. One contains an interesting diorama of the whole complex.Lesser Central HallsThe basic configuration of the Three Great Halls is echoed by the next group of buildings. Smaller in scale, these buildings were more important in terms of real power, which in China traditionally lies at the back door.The first structure is the Palace of Heavenly Purity , a residence of Ming and early Qing emperors, and later an audience hall for receiving foreign envoys and high officials.Immediately behind it is the Hall of Union , which contains a clepsydra – a water clock made in 1745 with five bronze vessels and a calibrated scale. There’s also a mechanical clock built in 1797 and a collection of imperial jade seals on display. The Palace of Earthly Tranquillity was the imperial couple’s bridal chamber and the centre of operations for the palace harem.Imperial GardenAt the northern end of the Forbidden City is the Imperial Garden , a classical Chinese garden with 7000 sq metres of fine landscaping, including rockeries, walkways, pavilions and ancient cypresses. Before you reach the Gate of Divine Prowess , the Forbidden City’s north exit, and Shùnzhēn Gate , which leads to it, note the pair of bronze elephants whose front knees bend in an anatomically impossible fashion, signifying the power of the emperor; even elephants would kowtow before him.Complete Palace of Peace and LongevityA mini Forbidden City, known as the Complete Palace of Peace and Longevity (宁寿全宫; Níng Shòu Quán Gōng) was built in the northeastern corner of the complex, mimicking the structure of the great halls of the central axis. During the Ming dynasty this was where the empress dowager and the imperial concubines lived. Now it houses a series of quieter courtyard buildings, which contain a number of fine museum exhibitions, known collectively as the Treasure Gallery .The complex is entered from the south – not far from the Clock Exhibition Hall. Just inside the entrance, you’ll find the beautiful glazed Nine Dragon Screen , one of only three of its type left in China.Visitors then work their way north, exploring a number of peaceful halls and courtyards before being popped out at the northern end of the Forbidden City. Don’t miss the Pavilion of Cheerful Melodies , a three-storey wooden opera house, which was the palace’s largest theatre. Note the trap doors that allowed actors to make dramatic stage entrances.Western and Eastern PalacesAbout half a dozen smaller palace courtyards lie to the west and east of the Lesser Central Halls. They should all be open to the public, although at the time of research many of the eastern ones were closed for extensive renovation. It was in these smaller courtyard buildings that most of the emperors actually lived and many of the buildings, particularly those to the west, are decked out in imperial furniture. The Hall of Mental Cultivation is a highlight, while the Palace of Gathered Elegance contains some interesting photos of the last emperor Puyi, who lived here as a child ruler at the turn of the 20th century.	150	116.390660177	39.9182701894	5.5	3364	1945	646	103	32	4.5	['8:30 - 15:30', '56:30 - 63:30', '80:30 - 87:30', '104:30 - 111:30', '128:30 - 135:30', '152:30 - 159:30']	['History Museums', 'Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
china	beijing	Temple of Heaven Park	A tranquil oasis of peace and methodical Confucian design in one of China’s busiest urban landscapes, the 267-hectare Temple of Heaven Park is absolutely unique. It originally served as a vast stage for solemn rites performed by the emperor of the time (known as the Son of Heaven), who prayed here for good harvests and sought divine clearance and atonement. Strictly speaking, it's an altar rather than a temple – so don’t expect burning incense or worshippers.Surrounded by a long wall and with a gate at each compass point, the arrangement is typical of Chinese parks, with the imperfections, bumps and wild irregularities of nature largely deleted and the harmonising hand of man accentuated in obsessively straight lines and regular arrangements. This effect is magnified by Confucian objectives, where the human intellect is imposed on the natural world, fashioning order and symmetry. The resulting balance and harmony have an almost haunting – but slightly claustrophobic – beauty. Police whir about in electric buggies as visitors stroll among old buildings, groves of ancient trees and birdsong. Around 4000 ancient, knotted cypresses (some 800 years old, their branches propped up on poles) poke towards the Běijīng skies within the grounds.Seen from above, the temple halls are round and the bases square, in accordance with the notion ‘Tiānyuán Dìfāng’ (天圆地方) – ‘Heaven is round, Earth is square’. Also observe that the northern rim of the park is semicircular, while its southern end is square. The traditional approach to the temple was from the south, via Zhāohēng Gate (昭亨门; Zhāohēng Mén); the north gate is an architectural afterthought.The highlight of the park, and an icon of Běijīng in its own right, is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests , an astonishing structure with a triple-eaved purplish-blue umbrella roof mounted on a three-tiered marble terrace. The wooden pillars (made from Oregon fir) support the ceiling without nails or cement – for a building 38m high and 30m in diameter, that’s quite an accomplishment. Embedded in the ceiling is a carved dragon, a symbol of the emperor. Built in 1420, the hall was reduced to carbon after being zapped by a lightning bolt during the reign of Guangxu in 1889; a faithful reproduction based on Ming architectural methods was erected the following year.Continuing south along an elevated imperial pathway, you soon reach the octagonal Imperial Vault of Heaven , which was erected at the same time as the Round Altar, but with its shape echoing the lines of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. The hall contained tablets of the emperor’s ancestors, employed during winter solstice ceremonies.Wrapped around the Imperial Vault of Heaven is Echo Wall . A whisper can travel clearly from one end to your friend’s ear at the other – unless a cacophonous tour group joins in (get here early for this one).Immediately south of Echo Wall, the 5m-high Round Altar was constructed in 1530 and rebuilt in 1740. Consisting of white marble arrayed in three tiers, its geometry revolves around the imperial number nine. Odd numbers possess heavenly significance, with nine the largest single-digit odd number. Symbolising heaven, the top tier is a huge mosaic of nine rings, each composed of multiples of nine stones, so that the ninth ring equals 81 stones. The stairs and balustrades are similarly presented in multiples of nine. Sounds generated from the centre of the upper terrace undergo amplification from the marble balustrades (the acoustics can get noisy when crowds join in).Off to the eastern side of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, and with a green-tiled tow-tier roof, the Animal Killing Pavilion was the venue for the slaughter of sacrificial oxen, sheep, deer and other animals. Today it stands locked and passive but can be admired from theoutside. Stretching out from here runs a Long Corridor , where locals sit out and deal cards, listen to the radio, play keyboards, practise Peking opera, try dance moves and kick hacky-sacks. Just north of here is a large and very popular exercise park.In the west of the park, sacrificial music was rehearsed at the Divine Music Administration , while wild cats inhabit the dry moat of the green-tiled Fasting Palace .	90	116.3998776	39.88413287	4.5	2875	1801	442	28	11	4.5	['6:00 - 20:00', '30:00 - 44:00', '54:00 - 68:00', '78:00 - 92:00', '102:00 - 116:00', '126:00 - 140:00', '150:00 - 164:00']	['Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Hòuhǎi Lakes	Also known as Shíchàhǎi (什刹海) but mostly just referred to collectively as ‘Hòuhǎi’, the Hòuhǎi Lakes are compromised of three lakes: Qiánhǎi (Front Lake), Hòuhǎi (Back Lake) and Xīhǎi (West Lake). Together they are one of the capital’s favourite outdoor spots, heaving with locals and out-of-towners in the summer especially, and providing great people-spotting action.During the day, senior citizens meander along, use the exercise machines scattered along the lakeshore, fish, fly kites or just sit and chew the fat. At night, the area turns into one of the more popular nightlife areas, as the restaurants, bars and cafes that surround the lakes spring into life. This is a night out, Chinese style, so be prepared for neon lights galore, and plenty of karaoke being blasted out onto the surrounding lanes. Meanwhile, as the midday sun disappears, the lakes become a mass of pedalos circling round and round.It’s great fun, and even if you find parts of the lakes too hectic (Silver Ingot Bridge is a major bottleneck), it's easy enough to escape the crowds, by exploring the many hútòng that run both east and west of the lakes, or to just venture further northwest towards the quieter Xīhǎi Lake. It’s particularly good to cycle around and numerous places by the lakeshores hire out bikes by the hour (¥10 per hour, ¥200 deposit). There are many spots to rent pedalos too (¥80 per hour, ¥300 deposit), if you want to take to the water. Some locals swim in the lakes, even in midwinter!The lakes look majestic in winter, when they freeze over and become the best place in Běijīng to ice skate (usually for around six weeks in January and February. Qiánhǎi Lake is most popular, although some people skate on Hòuhǎi Lake too; local vendors set themselves up with all the gear you need. You have to pay to enter the ice-skating area (weekday/weekend & evenings ¥15/¥20). If you want to rent ice skates and the like, you also have to buy a rental swipe card from kiosks by the entrance gates. The card will have a ¥200 deposit on it. You then get back any money you don't use. Skates (¥20 per day), chair sleds (¥20 per day), ice bikes ¥40 per hour) and even ice bumper cars (¥20 per 10 minutes) can all be rented. There is also a giant ice slide (¥5 per go).	90	116.381307	39.939513	5.5	468	407	80	16	3	4.5	[]	['Bodies of Water', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Zhìhuà Temple	Běijīng’s surviving temple brood has endured casual restoration that often buried authenticity. But this rickety nonactive temple, hidden down a rarely visited hútòng, is thick with the flavours of old Peking, having eluded the Dulux treatment that invariably precedes entrance fee inflation and stomping tour groups.You won’t find the coffered ceiling of the Zhìhuà Hall (it’s in the USA), and the Four Heavenly Kings have vanished from Zhìhuà Gate (智化门; Zhìhuà Mén), but the Scriptures Hall , off to one side of the central courtyard, encases a unique, eight-sided, Ming-dynasty wooden library topped with a seated Buddha and a magnificently unrestored ceiling. The highlight, the Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall (万佛殿; Wànfó Diàn), is right at the back of the complex, and is an enticing two floors of miniature niche-borne Buddhist effigies and cabinets for the storage of sutras. Its entrance is dominated by three stunning, wood-carved deities (a 20ft-tall Tathagata Buddha, flanked by Brahma and Indra). Unfortunately, visitors are no longer allowed to climb to the 2nd floor of this hall.Try to time your visit to coincide with the free, 15-minute, musical performance which takes place in Zhìhuà Hall at 10am and 3pm each day. Performers use traditional Chinese instruments associated with Buddhist worship.Note the surreal juxtaposition of this 15th-century temple with the swirling, space-age curves of the Galaxy Soho buildings, which now loom over this historic hútòng neighbourhood.	90	116.426057	39.915777	4.0	4	7	2	0	0	4.0	['9:00 - 21:00', '33:00 - 45:00', '57:00 - 69:00', '81:00 - 93:00', '105:00 - 117:00', '129:00 - 141:00', '153:00 - 165:00']	['Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Jǐngshān Park	The dominating feature of Jǐngshān – one of the city’s finest parks – is one of central Běijīng’s few hills; a mound that was created from the earth excavated to make the Forbidden City moat. Called Coal Hill by Westerners during Legation days, Jǐngshān also serves as a feng shui shield, protecting the palace from evil spirits – or dust storms – from the north. Clamber to the top for a magnificent panorama of the capital and princely views over the russet roofing of the Forbidden City.On the eastern side of the park a locust tree stands in the place where the last of the Ming emperors, Chongzhen, hung himself as rebels swarmed at the city walls. The rest of the park is one of the best places in Běijīng for people-watching. Come early to see (or join in with) elderly folk going about their morning routines of dancing, singing, performing taichi or playing keepie-uppies with oversized shuttlecocks. In April and May the park bursts into bloom with fabulously colourful peonies and tulips forming the focal point of a very popular flower fair (admission ¥10). The park has three gates: the south is directly opposite the Forbidden City's north gate (exit only), the west leads towards Běihǎi Park's east gate, while the east gate has a couple of nice cafes outside it.	90	116.390548135	39.9230784754	5.5	795	532	59	2	2	4.5	[]	['Lookouts', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	True	activity
china	beijing	White Cloud Temple	White Cloud Temple, once the Taoist centre of northern China, was founded in AD 739, although most of the temple halls date from the Qing dynasty. It’s a lively, huge and fascinating complex of shrines and courtyards, tended by Taoist monks with their hair gathered into topknots.Near the temple entrance, worshippers rub a polished stone carving for good fortune. The halls at the temple, centre of operations for the Taoist Quanzhen School and abode of the China Taoist Association, are dedicated to a host of Taoist officials and marshals. The Hall of the Jade Emperor celebrates this most famous of Taoist deities, while Taoist housewives cluster earnestly at the Hall to the God of Wealth to divine their financial future. Depictions of the Taoist Hell festoon the walls of the Shrine Hall for the Saviour Worthy.Drop by White Cloud Temple during the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and you will be rewarded with the spectacle of a magnificent temple fair (miàohuì ).The temple is about a 1km-walk from Muxidi subway station (Line 1).

china	beijing	Zhōngshān Park	Named after Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yatsen), the father of modern China, this peaceful park sits at the southwest corner of the Forbidden City and partly looks out onto the palace’s moat (you can rent pedal-boats here) and towering walls. A refreshing prologue or conclusion to the magnificence of the Forbidden City, the park was formerly the sacred Ming-style Altar to the God of the Land and the God of Grain (Shèjìtán), where the emperor offered sacrifices. The Square Altar remains, bordered on all sides by walls tiled in various coloursNear the park's south entrance stands a towering dark-blue-tiled páilou (traditional Chinese archway) with triple eaves that originally commemorated the German Foreign Minister Baron von Ketteler, killed by Boxers in 1900. Just off to the right (east) is the 100-year-old Láijīnyǔxuān Teahouse . North of here, also in the eastern section of the park, is the Forbidden City Concert Hall . As with Jǐngshān Park, April and May is a beautiful time to visit thanks to the hugely colourful Spring Flower and Tulips Show. The northeast exit of the park brings you out by Meridian Gate, from where you can enter the Forbidden City. The south exit brings you out near Tiān’ānmén Sq.

china	beijing	Summer Palace	As mandatory a Běijīng sight as the Great Wall or the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace was the playground for emperors fleeing the suffocating summer torpor of the old imperial city. A marvel of design, the palace – with its huge lake and hilltop views – offers a pastoral escape into the landscapes of traditional Chinese painting. It merits an entire day’s exploration, although a (high-paced) morning or afternoon exploring the temples, gardens, pavilions, bridges and corridors may suffice.The domain had long been a royal garden before being considerably enlarged and embellished by Emperor Qianlong in the 18th century. He marshalled a 100,000-strong army of labourers to deepen and expand Kūnmíng Lake (昆明湖; Kūnmíng Hú), and reputedly surveyed imperial navy drills from a hilltop perch.Anglo-French troops vandalised the palace during the Second Opium War (1856–60). Empress Dowager Cixi launched into a refit in 1888 with money earmarked for a modern navy; the marble boat at the northern edge of the lake was her only nautical, albeit quite unsinkable, concession. Foreign troops, angered by the Boxer Rebellion, had another go at torching the Summer Palace in 1900, prompting further restoration work. By 1949 the palace had once more fallen into disrepair, eliciting a major overhaul.Glittering Kūnmíng Lake swallows up three-quarters of the park, overlooked by Longevity Hill (万寿山; Wànshòu Shān). The principal structure is the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity , by the east gate, housing a hardwood throne and attached to a courtyard decorated with bronze animals, including the mythical qílín (a hybrid animal that only appeared on earth at times of harmony). Unfortunately, the hall is barricaded off so you will have to peer in.An elegant stretch of woodwork along the northern shore, the Long Corridor is trimmed with a plethora of paintings, while the slopes and crest of Longevity Hill behind are adorned with Buddhist temples. Slung out uphill on a north-south axis, the Buddhist Fragrance Pavilion and the Cloud Dispelling Hall are linked by corridors. Crowning the peak is the Buddhist Temple of the Sea of Wisdom tiled with effigies of Buddha, many with obliterated heads.Cixi’s marble boat sits immobile on the north shore, south of some fine Qing boathouses . When the lake is not frozen, you can traverse Kūnmíng Lake by ferry to South Lake Island (南湖岛; Nánhú Dǎo), where Cixi went to beseech the Dragon King Temple for rain in times of drought. A graceful 17-arch bridge spans the 150m to the eastern shore of the lake. In warm weather, pedal boats are also available from the dock.Try to do a circuit of the lake along the West Causeway to return along the east shore (or vice versa). It gets you away from the crowds, the views are gorgeous and it’s a great cardiovascular workout. Based on the Su Causeway in Hángzhōu, and lined with willow and mulberry trees, the causeway kicks off just west of the boathouses. With its delightful hump, the grey and white marble Jade Belt Bridge) dates from the reign of emperor Qianlong and crosses the point where the Jade River (Yùhé) enters the lake (when it flows).Towards the North Palace Gate, Sūzhōu Street (苏州街; Sūzhōu Jiē) is an entertaining and light-hearted diversion of riverside walkways, shops and eateries, which are designed to mimic the famous Jiāngsū canal town.	210	116.2679616	39.99715031	4.5	4310	2445	489	47	15	4.5	['6:30 - 18:00', '30:30 - 42:00', '54:30 - 66:00', '78:30 - 90:00', '102:30 - 114:00', '126:30 - 138:00', '150:30 - 162:00']	['Castles', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Outdoor Activities']	False	activity
china	beijing	Old Summer Palace	Located northwest of the city centre, the Old Summer Palace was laid out in the 12th century. The ever-capable Jesuits were later employed by Emperor Qianlong to fashion European-style palaces for the gardens, incorporating elaborate fountains and baroque statuary. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, British and French troops torched and looted the palace, an event forever inscribed in Chinese history books as a low point in China’s humiliation by foreign powers. Most of the wooden palace buildings were burned down in the process and little remains, but the hardier Jesuit-designed European Palace buildings were made of stone, and a melancholic tangle of broken columns and marble chunks survives. Note: to see these remains, you need to buy the more expensive through ticket.The subdued marble ruins of the Palace Buildings Scenic Area (Xīyánglóu Jǐngqū) can be mulled over in the Eternal Spring Garden (Chángchūn Yuán) in the northeast of the park, near the east gate. There were once more than 10 buildings here, designed by Giuseppe Castiglione and Michael Benoist. The buildings were only partially destroyed during the 1860 Anglo-French looting and the structures apparently remained usable for quite some time afterwards. However, the ruins were gradually picked over and carted away by local people all the way up to the 1970s.The Great Fountain Ruins (Dàshuǐfǎ) themselves are considered the best-preserved relics. Built in 1759, the main building was fronted by a lion-head fountain. Standing opposite is the Guānshuǐfǎ , five large stone screens embellished with European carvings of military flags, armour, swords and guns. The screens were discovered in the grounds of Peking University in the 1970s and later restored to their original positions. Just east of the Great Fountain Ruins stood a four-pillar archway, chunks of which remain.West of the Great Fountain Ruins are the vestiges of the Hǎiyàntáng Reservoir (Hǎiyàntáng Xùshuǐchí Táijī), where the water for the impressive fountains was stored in a tower and huge water-lifting devices were employed. The metal reservoir was commonly called the Tin Sea (Xīhǎi). Also known as the Water Clock, the Hǎiyàntáng , where 12 bronze human statues with animal heads jetted water for two hours in a 12-hour sequence, was constructed in 1759. The 12 animal heads from this apparatus ended up in collections abroad and Běijīng is attempting to retrieve them (four can now be seen at the Poly Art Museum). Just west of here is the Fāngwàiguàn , a building that was turned into a mosque for an imperial concubine. An artful reproduction of a former labyrinth called the Garden of Yellow Flowers is also nearby.The palace gardens cover a huge area – 2.5km from east to west – so be prepared for some walking. Besides the ruins, there’s the western section, the Perfection & Brightness Garden (Yuánmíng Yuán) and, in the southern compound, the 10,000 Springs Garden (Wànchūn Yuán).Bus 331 goes from the south gate (which is by Exit B of Yuanmingyuan subway station) to the east gate of the Summer Palace before continuing to the Botanic Gardens and eventually terminating at Fragrant Hills Park.	150	116.3003058	39.99871641	5.0	215	258	86	7	5	4.0	[]	['Ancient Ruins', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Wànshòu Temple	Ringed by a red wall on the southeastern corner of Suzhou Jie (off the 3rd Ring Rd), the tranquil, little-visited Ming-dynasty Wànshòu Temple, or Longevity Temple, was originally consecrated for the storage of Buddhist texts. Its name echoes the Summer Palace’s Longevity Hill (Wànshòu Shān), and the imperial entourage would stop here to quaff tea en route to and from the palace.The temple was one of almost 50 that once lined the canal route from the western edge of the Imperial City walls (at Xīzhímén) to the Summer Palace. Now it is pretty much the only one that remains (Wǔtǎ Temple being another notable survivor). The temple fell into disrepair after the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, with the Wànshòu Hall burning down. Things went from bad to worse, and during the Cultural Revolution the temple served as an army barracks.There’s an interesting introduction to the history of the temple in the small hall (once the temple’s Drum Tower) immediately to your left as you enter the complex. And as you walk through the Hall of the Deva Kings, which leads to the second courtyard, notice the illustration on your right that shows all the temples that once lined the canal. The names are in Chinese only, but see if you can spot the temple you’re in (万寿寺) as well as neighbouring Yánqìng Temple (延庆寺; Yánqìng Sì), nearby Dragon King Temple (龙王庙; Lóngwáng Sì) and the magnificent Wǔtǎ Temple (marked on the map with its former name, 真觉寺), all of which still stand, at least in part.The highlight of a visit here, though, is to view the prized collection of bronze Buddhist statuary in the Buddhist Art Exhibition of Ming and Qing Dynasties, housed in two small halls on either side of the second courtyard. The displays guide you through the Buddhist pantheon with statues of Sakyamuni, Manjusri, Amitabha, Guanyin (in bronze and déhuà , or white-glazed porcelain) and exotic tantric pieces. Also look out for the kapala bowl made from a human skull, dorje and purbhas (Tibetan ritual daggers). Further halls contain museum exhibitions devoted to Ming and Qing porcelain and jade.Also worth checking out are the Buddhist stone and clay sculptures housed in the large unnamed central hall at the back of the second courtyard. There are four magnificent central pieces, plus a dozen or so arhats (Buddhist disciples) lining the flanks. The pavilion at the rear of the whole complex once housed a 5m-high gold-lacquered brass statue that's now long gone; in its place is a miniature Ming-dynasty pagoda alloyed from gold, silver, zinc and lead.Note that on Wednesdays the first 200 visitors get in for free.As you exit the temple, see if you can track down the nearby remains of Yánqìng Temple and Dragon King Temple, further east along the canal. To walk from here to Wǔtǎ Temple takes around 20 minutes.	90	116.305121	39.944925	3.5	8	4	8	2	2	3.5	[]	['Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Lama Temple	This exceptional temple is a glittering attraction in Běijīng’s Buddhist firmament. If you only have time for one temple (the Temple of Heaven isn’t really a temple) make it this one, where riveting roofs, fabulous frescoes, magnificent decorative arches, tapestries, eye-popping carpentry, Tibetan prayer wheels, Tantric statues and a superb pair of Chinese lions mingle with dense clouds of incense.The most renowned Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet, the Lama Temple was converted to a lamasery in 1744 after serving as the former residence of Emperor Yong Zheng. Today the temple is an active place of worship, attracting pilgrims from afar, some of whom prostrate themselves in submission at full length within its halls.Resplendent within the Hall of the Wheel of the Law (Fǎlún Diàn), the fourth hall you reach from the entrance, is a substantial bronze statue of a benign and smiling Tsong Khapa (1357–1419), founder of the Gelugpa or Yellow Hat sect, robed in yellow and illuminated by a skylight.The fifth hall, the Wànfú Pavilion (Wànfú Gé), houses a magnificent 18m-high statue of the Maitreya Buddha in his Tibetan form, clothed in yellow satin and reputedly sculpted from a single block of sandalwood. Each of the Bodhisattva’s toes is the size of a pillow. Behind the statue is the Vault of Avalokiteshvara, from where a diminutive and blue-faced statue of Guanyin peeks out. The Wànfú Pavilion is linked by an overhead walkway to the Yánsuí Pavilion (Yánsuí Gé), which encloses a huge lotus flower that revolves to reveal an effigy of the Longevity Buddha.Don’t miss the collection of bronze Tibetan Buddhist statues within the Jiètái Lóu , a small side hall. Most effigies date from the Qing dynasty, from languorous renditions of Green Tara and White Tara to exotic, Tantric pieces (such as Samvara) and figurines of the fierce-looking Mahakala. Also peruse the collection of Tibetan Buddhist ornaments within the Bānchán Lóu , another side hall, where an array of dorje (Tibetan sceptres), mandalas and Tantric figures are displayed along with an impressive selection of ceremonial robes in silk and satin.The street outside the temple entrance heaves with shops piled high with statues of Buddha, talismans, Buddhist charms, incense and keepsakes, picked over by a constant stream of pilgrims.	90	116.410811	39.944909	5.5	956	696	152	15	2	4.5	['9:00 - 16:30', '33:00 - 40:30', '57:00 - 64:30', '81:00 - 88:30', '105:00 - 112:30', '129:00 - 136:30', '153:00 - 160:30']	['History Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
china	beijing	Tiān’ānmén Square	Flanked by stern 1950s Soviet-style buildings and ringed by white perimeter fences, the world’s largest public square (440,000 sq metres) is an immense flatland of paving stones at the heart of Běijīng. If you get up early, you can watch the flagraising ceremony at sunrise, performed by a troop of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers drilled to march at precisely 108 paces per minute, 75cm per pace. The soldiers emerge through the Gate of Heavenly Peace to goosestep impeccably across Chang’an Jie; all traffic is halted. The same ceremony in reverse is performed at sunset.Here one stands at the symbolic centre of the Chinese universe. The rectangular arrangement, flanked by halls to both east and west, to some extent echoes the layout of the Forbidden City: as such, the square employs a conventional plan that pays obeisance to traditional Chinese culture, but many of its ornaments and buildings are Soviet- inspired. Mao conceived the square to project the enormity of the Communist Party, and during the Cultural Revolution he reviewed parades of up to a million people here. The ‘Tiān’ānmén Incident’, in 1976, is the term given to the near-riot in the square that accompanied the death of Premier Zhou Enlai. Another million people jammed the square to pay their last respects to Mao in the same year. Most infamously, in 1989 the army forced prodemocracy demonstrators out of the square. Hundreds lost their lives in the surrounding streets, although contrary to widespread belief, it is unlikely that anyone was killed in the square itself.Despite being a public place, the square remains more in the hands of the government than the people; it is monitored by closed circuit TV cameras, Segway-riding policemen and plain-clothes officers. The designated points of access, security checks on entry and twitchy mood cleave Tiān’ānmén Square from the city. A tangible atmosphere of restraint and authority reigns.All this – plus the absence of anywhere to sit – means the square is hardly a place to chill out (don’t whip out a guitar), but such is its iconic status that few people leave Běijīng without making a visit. In any case, there’s more than enough space to stretch a leg and the view can be breathtaking, especially on a clear blue day or at nightfall when the area is illuminated.	90	116.391563	39.902379	4.0	920	985	601	91	39	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Dōngyuè Temple	Dedicated to the Eastern Peak (Tài Shān) of China’s five Taoist mountains, the morbid Taoist shrine of Dōngyuè Temple is an unsettling, albeit fascinating, experience and one of the capital's most unique temples. An active place of worship tended by top-knotted Taoist monks, the temple's roots go all the way back to the Yuan dynasty. A visit here takes you into a world entirely at odds with the surrounding glass and steel high-rises.Before going in, note the temple’s fabulous Páifāng (memorial archway) lying to the south, divorced from its shrine by the intervention of the busy main road, Chaoyangmenwai Dajie.Stepping through the entrance pops you into a Taoist Hades, where tormented spirits reflect on their wrongdoing and elusive atonement. You can muse on life’s finalities in the Life and Death Department or the Final Indictment Department. Otherwise get spooked at the Department for Wandering Ghosts or the Department for Implementing 15 Kinds of Violent Death .It’s not all doom and gloom: the luckless can check in at the Department for Increasing Good Fortune and Longevity . Ornithologists will be birds of a feather with the Flying Birds Department , while the infirm can seek cures at the Deep-Rooted Disease Department . The Animal Department has colourful and lively fauna. English explanations detail department functions.Other halls are no less fascinating. The huge Dàiyuè Hall (Dàiyuè Diàn) is consecrated to the God of Tàishān, who manages the 18 layers of hell. Visit during festival time, especially during the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and you’ll see the temple at its most vibrant.Just outside the complex, in a small car park to the east, stands the handsome, but rather lonely Jiǔtiān Pǔhuā Gōng (九天普化宫), a small temple hall which is the only remaining structure of two other Taoist temples that once also stood in this area. Built in 1647, the hall, which we think is now empty, once contained more than 70 clay and wooden statues dedicated to Léizǔ (雷祖), Taoism’s God of Thunder. Unfortunately, it's not open to the public. Note the two impressive stone tablets that rise up from the platform at the front.	90	116.438673634	39.9225049037	4.5	12	17	2	1	0	4.5	['8:00 - 18:00', '32:00 - 42:00', '56:00 - 66:00', '80:00 - 90:00', '104:00 - 114:00', '128:00 - 138:00', '152:00 - 162:00']	['Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Fragrant Hills Park	Easily within striking distance of the Summer Palace are Běijīng’s Western Hills (西山; Xī Shān), another former villa-resort of the emperors. The part of Xī Shān closest to Běijīng is known as Fragrant Hills Park. Beijingers flock here in autumn when the maple leaves saturate the hillsides in great splashes of red.Scramble up the slopes to the top of Incense-Burner Peak (Xiānglú Fēng), or take the chairlift (one way/return ¥60/120, 9.30am to 3.30pm). From the peak you get an all-embracing view of the countryside, and you can leave the crowds behind by hiking further into the Western Hills. Near the north gate of Fragrant Hills Park, but still within the park, is the excellent Azure Clouds Temple , which dates back to the Yuán dynasty. The Mountain Gate Hall (Shānmén) contains two vast protective deities: Heng and Ha, beyond which is a small courtyard and the drum and bell towers, leading to a hall with a wonderful statue of Mílèfó – it’s bronze, but coal-black with age. Only his big toe shines from numerous inquisitive fingers.The Sun Yatsen Memorial Hall (Sūn Zhōngshān Jìniàn Tāng) contains a statue and a glass coffin donated by the USSR on the death of Mr Sun (the Republic of China's first president) in 1925. At the very back is the marble Vajra Throne Pagoda (Jīngāng Bǎozuò Tǎ), where Sun Yatsen was interred after he died, before his body was moved to its final resting place in Nánjīng. The Hall of Arhats (Luóhán Tāng) is well worth visiting; it contains 500 statues of luóhàn (those freed from the cycle of rebirth), each crafted with an individual personality.Southwest of the Azure Clouds Temple is the Tibetan-style Temple of Brilliance (Zhāo Miào), and not far away is a glazed-tile pagoda. Both survived visits by foreign troops intent on sacking the area in 1860, and then in 1900.There are dozens of cheap restaurants and snack stalls on the approach road to the north gate of the park, making this your best bet for lunch out of any of the sights in this part of the city.At the time of writing it was expected that sometime after 2015 the subway will extend here via the Summer Palace and Botanic Gardens.	150	116.18550539	39.9872975804	5.0	259	316	142	7	4	4.0	[]	['Nature & Parks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Běihǎi Park	Běihǎi Park, northwest of the Forbidden City , is largely occupied by the North Sea (běihǎi), a huge lake that freezes in winter and blooms with lotuses in summer. Old folk dance together outside temple halls and come twilight, young couples cuddle on benches. It’s a restful place to stroll around, rent a rowing boat in summer and watch calligraphers practising characters on paving slabs with fat brushes and water.The site is associated with Kublai Khaan’s palace, Běijīng’s navel before the arrival of the Forbidden City. All that survives of the Khan’s court is a large jar made of green jade in the Round City (团城; Tuánchéng), near the southern entrance. Also within the Round City is the Chengguang Hall (Chéngguāng Diàn), where a white jade statue of Sakyamuni from Myanmar (Burma) can be found, its arm wounded by the allied forces that swarmed through Běijīng in 1900 to quash the Boxer Rebellion. At the time of writing, the Round City was closed to visitors.Attached to the North Sea, the South (Nánhǎi) and Middle (Zhōnghǎi) Seas to the south lend their name to Zhōngnánhǎi (literally ‘Middle and South Seas’), the heavily-guarded compound less than a mile south of the park where the Chinese Communist Party’s top leadership live.Topping Jade Islet (琼岛; Qióngdǎo) on the lake, the 36m-high Tibetan-style White Dagoba (白塔; Báitǎ) was built in 1651 for a visit by the Dalai Lama, and was rebuilt in 1741. Climb up to the dagoba via the Yǒng’ān Temple (永安寺; Yǒng’ān Sì).Xītiān Fánjìng (西天梵境; Western Paradise), situated on the northern shore of the lake, is a lovely temple (admission to which is included in the park ticket). The nearby Nine Dragon Screen (九龙壁; Jiǔlóng Bì), a 5m-high and 27m-long spirit wall, is a glimmering stretch of coloured glazed tiles depicting coiling dragons, similar to its counterpart in the Forbidden City. West, along the shore, is the pleasant Little Western Heaven (小西天; Xiǎo Xītiān), a further shrine.	90	116.383433421	39.9249505534	5.5	802	568	96	6	1	4.5	[]	['Bodies of Water', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Confucius Temple & Imperial College	An incense stick’s toss away from the Lama Temple, China’s second-largest Confucian temple had a refit in recent years, but the almost otherworldly sense of detachment is seemingly impossible to shift. A mood of impassiveness reigns and the lack of worship reinforces a sensation that time has stood still. However, in its tranquillity and reserve, the temple can be a pleasant sanctuary from Běijīng’s often congested streets – a haven of peace and quiet.Antediluvian bìxì (mythical tortoise-like dragons) glare from repainted pavilions while lumpy and ossified ancient cypresses claw stiffly at the Běijīng air. There's a stone 'forest' of 190 stelae recording the 13 Confucian classics in 630,000 Chinese characters at the temple rear. Also inscribed on stelae are the names of successful candidates of the highest level of the official Confucian examination system.Next to the Confucius Temple, but within the same grounds, stands the Imperial College, where the emperor expounded the Confucian classics to an audience of thousands of kneeling students, professors and court officials – an annual rite. Built by the grandson of Kublai Khan in 1306, the former college was the supreme academy during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. On the site is a marvellous, glazed, three-gate, single-eaved decorative archway called a liúli páifāng (glazed archway). The Biyong Hall beyond is a twin-roofed structure with yellow tiles surrounded by a moat and topped with a splendid gold knob. Its stupendous interior houses a vermillion and gold lectern.Some of Běijīng’s last remaining páilou (decorated archways) bravely survive in the tree-lined street outside (Guozijian Jie) and the entire area of hútòng here is now dotted with small cafes, cute restaurants and boutique shops, making it an ideal place to browse in low gear. At the western end of Guozijian Jie stands a diminutive Fire God Temple , built in 1802 and now occupied by Běijīng residents.	120	116.407807	39.944201	5.0	75	90	33	3	1	4.0	['8:30 - 17:00', '32:30 - 41:00', '56:30 - 65:00', '80:30 - 89:00', '104:30 - 113:00', '128:30 - 137:00', '152:30 - 161:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
china	beijing	Wǔtǎ Temple	Undergoing renovations at the time of writing, the distinctive Indian-styled Wǔtǎ Temple (Five Pagoda Temple) is a hugely rewarding place to visit. That's not just because of its unusual architectural style – the temple is topped by its five attractive namesake pagodas – but also because of the magnificent collection of stone carvings contained within its grounds.Previously known as Zhēnjué Temple (真觉寺; Zhēnjué Sì), the exterior of the main hall is decorated with dorje , hundreds of images of Buddha and legions of beasts, amid traces of red pigment. During Ming times the temple ranged to at least six halls, all later tiled in yellow during Qing times; the terrace where the Big Treasure Hall once stood can still be seen. The temple, dating from 1473, is highly unusual for Běijīng, and well worth a visit in itself, but the highlight here is the extraordinary collection of stone carvings, some housed carefully in buildings at the back of the complex but many just scattered around the temple grounds. Pieces you might stumble across include gravestones, animal statues, carved human figures, stone stele and some enormous bìxì (mythical tortoiselike dragons often seen in Confucian temples). The pieces were all recovered from various places in Běijīng and put here for their protection during the latter end of the last century. Most are Qing and Ming dynasty, but there are a number of Yuan, Tang, Jin and even Eastern Han dynasty pieces, some of which are almost 2000 years old. Many, although not all, have explanatory captions in English; those captioned in Chinese only do at least have the date of origin written in numerals.As with Wànshòu Temple, on Wednesdays the first 200 visitors get in for free. Take Exit C at the National Library subway stop and then take the first left to get here.Note, you can enter the north gate of Běijīng Zoo from here. Cross the canal over the decorative arched bridge.	90	116.325034	39.942507	4.5	8	4	3	0	0	4.5	['9:00 - 16:00', '33:00 - 40:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']	['Religious Sites', 'Bridges', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Bell Tower	The more modest, grey-stone structure of the Bell Tower (钟楼; Zhōnglóu) is arguably more charming than its resplendent other half, the Drum Tower, after which this area of Běijīng is named. It also has the added advantage of being able to view its sister tower from a balcony.Along with the drums in the Drum Tower, the bells in the Bell Tower were used as Běijīng’s official timekeepers throughout the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, and on until 1924. The Bell Tower looks the older of the two, perhaps because it isn’t painted. In fact both are of similar age. The Bell Tower was also built during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, in 1272, and was rebuild in the 1440s after being destroyed in a fire. This current structure was built in 1745.Like the Drum Tower, the Bell Tower can also be climbed up an incredibly steep inner staircase. But the views from the top are even better here, partly because the structure is set back more deeply into the surrounding hútòng, and partly because you can get great photos of the Drum Tower from its viewing balcony. Marvel too at the huge, 600-year-old, 63-tonne bell suspended in the pleasantly unrestored interior. Note how Chinese bells have no clappers but are instead struck with a stout pole.Inside the tower, on the ground floor (south side), is the Bell Tower Tea House, where you can sample a selection of Chinese teas (per person per hour ¥50) as well as buy tea and tea sets.The Drum & Bell Sq, between the two towers, is a great people-watching area in which to while away some time even if you don’t climb either of the two towers. There are a handful of excellent bars and cafes here too, some with rooftop views over the square. Both towers are lit up beautifully come evening. Note: the square was undergoing wholesale renovations at the time of research.	90	116.389578544	39.9411023083	4.0	72	118	69	10	1	4.0	[]	['Observation Decks & Towers', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Southeast Corner Watchtower & Red Gate Gallery	This splendid fortification, with a green-tiled, twin-eaved roof rising up imperiously south of the Ancient Observatory, dates back to the Ming dynasty. Mount the battlements for views alongside camera-wielding Chinese trainspotters eagerly awaiting rolling stock grinding in and out of Běijīng Train Station. Make sure to hunt out the signatures etched in the walls by allied forces during the Boxer Rebellion.You can make out the name of a certain P Foot; ‘USA’ is also scrawled on the brickwork. The international composition of the eight-nation force that relieved Běijīng in 1900 is noted in names such as André, Stickel and what appears to be a name in Cyrillic. One brick records the date ‘Dec 16 1900’. Allied forces overwhelmed the redoubt after a lengthy engagement. Note the drainage channels poking out of the wall along its length. You can reach the watchtower from the west through the Railway Arch, which was built for the first railway that ran around Běijīng.The watchtower is punctured with 144 archers’ windows, as well as two forlorn stumps of flag abutments and a cannon or two. Attached to it is a 100m section of the original Inner City Wall, beyond which stretches the restored Ming City Wall extending all the way to Chongwenmen and north to Beijingzhan Dongjie. Inside the highly impressive interior is some staggering carpentry: huge red pillars that are topped with solid beams surge upwards. The 1st floor is the site of the Red Gate Gallery , one of Běijīng’s long-established modern art galleries. The 3rd-floor gallery has a fascinating photographic exhibition on the old gates of Běijīng, while the 4th-floor gallery contains more paintings. Say you are visiting the Red Gate Gallery and the ¥10 entry fee to the watchtower is normally waived.		116.428730064	39.9002966851	None							[]	[]		activity
china	beijing	Bādàchù	Named after the eight nunneries and monasteries scattered through its attractive wooded valleys, Bādàchù is an invigoratingly hilly area in the west of Běijīng. Topped with a glittering golden spire, the 13-eaved green tiled brick Língguāng Temple Pagoda (Língguāng Sì Tǎ) is also known as the Buddha's Tooth Relic Pagoda; it was built to house a sacred tooth accidentally discovered when the allied powers demolished the place in 1900.Follow the path up past the small and simple Sānshān Nunnery (Sānshān Ān) to the Dàbēi Temple (大悲寺; Dàbēi Sì), famed for its 18 arhats (Buddhists who have achieved enlightenment) in the Great Treasure Hall (Dàxióngbǎo Diàn) which were carved by Liu Yuan, a Yuan-dynasty sculptor. Made from a composite of sand and sandalwood, the effigies are over 700 years old. The exterior walls of the hall itself are decorated with slogans from the Cultural Revolution glorifying the supremacy of the Communist Party.Further slogans adorn the gate to Lóngquán Nunnery (Lóngquán Ān; 龙泉庵). Peek into the Lóngwáng Hall (Lóngwáng Táng) where the Dragon King sits with huge, round black eyes. The largest of all the temples is Xiāngjiè Temple (Xiāngjiè Sì).The mountain has plentiful apricot trees, which makes for some cheerful and sweet-smelling scenery around April when the trees briefly bloom. As with other sights, it is inadvisable to visit at weekends, which are busy. A cable car exists for trips to the top of the hill (Y20) and a toboggan (Y40) can sweep you down again. A fast way to reach Bādàchù is to take the underground to Píngguǒyuán station and then jump on bus 958 or 389; alternatively, get bus 347 from the zoo.	210	None	None	4.5	56	78	14	0	1	4.5	[]	['Religious Sites', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Běijīng Botanic Gardens	Exploding with blossom in spring, the well-tended Běijīng Botanic Gardens, set against the backdrop of the Western Hills and about 1km northeast of Fragrant Hills Park, makes for a pleasant outing among bamboo fronds, pines, orchids, lilacs and China’s most extensive botanic collection. Containing a rainforest house, the standout Běijīng Botanical Gardens Conservatory bursts with 3000 different varieties of plants.About a 15-minute walk from the front gate (follow the signs), but still within the grounds of the gardens, is Sleeping Buddha Temple . The temple, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses a huge reclining effigy of Sakyamuni weighing 54 tonnes; it’s said to have ‘enslaved 7000 people’ in its casting. Sakyamuni is depicted on the cusp of death, before his entry into nirvana. On each side of Buddha are arrayed some sets of gargantuan shoes, gifts to Sakyamuni from various emperors in case he went for a stroll.On the eastern side of the gardens is the Cao Xueqin Memorial , where Cao Xueqin lived in his latter years. Cao (1715–63) is credited with penning the classic Dream of the Red Mansions , a vast and prolix family saga set in the Qing period. Making a small buzz in the west of the gardens is the little China Honey Bee Museum (中国蜜蜂博物馆, Zhōngguó Mìfēng Bówùguǎn), open 8.30am to 4.30pm March to October.	120	116.2034655	39.99760505	5.5	111	88	16	2	0	4.5	['6:00 - 19:00', '30:00 - 43:00', '54:00 - 67:00', '78:00 - 91:00', '102:00 - 115:00', '126:00 - 139:00', '150:00 - 163:00']	['Science Museums', 'Museums', 'Nature & Parks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Drum Tower	Along with the older-looking Bell Tower , which stands behind it, the magnificent redpainted Drum Tower used to be the city’s official timekeeper, with drums and bells beaten and rung to mark the times of the day.Originally built in 1272, the Drum Tower was once the heart of the Mongol capital of Dàdū, as Běijīng was then known. It was destroyed in a fire before a replacement was built, slightly to the east of the original location, in 1420. The current structure is a Qing-dynasty version of that 1420 tower.You can climb the steep inner staircase for views of the grey-tiled rooftops in the surrounding hútòng alleys. But, you can’t view the Bell Tower as the north-facing balcony has been closed. It’s well worth climbing the tower, though, especially if you can time it to coincide with one of the regular drumming performances, which are played out on reproductions of the 25 Ming-dynasty watch drums, which used to sound out across this part of the city. One of the original 25 drums, the Night Watchman’s Drum (更鼓; Gēnggǔ), is also on display; dusty, battered and worn. Also on display is a replica of a Song-dynasty water clock, which was never actually used in the tower, but is interesting nonetheless.The times of the drumming performances , which only last for a few minutes, are posted by the ticket office.	90	116.389606027	39.9393640391	4.0	72	118	69	10	1	4.0	[]	['Observation Decks & Towers', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Workers Cultural Palace	Despite the prosaic name and its location at the very heart of town, this reclusive park, between Tiān’ānmén Sq and the Forbidden City, is one of Běijīng’s best-kept secrets. Few visitors divert here from their course towards the main gate of the Forbidden City, but this was the emperor’s premier place of worship and contains the Supreme Temple , with its beautifully carved interior roofing.If you find the Forbidden City either too colossal or crowded, the temple halls here are a cheaper, more tranquil and more manageable alternative. Enter the temple area of the park through the striking Glazed Gate (琉璃门; Liúli Mén). Then, rising up to the splendid Front Hall are three flights of steps. Only gods could traverse the central plinth; the emperor was consigned to the left-hand flight. Note how the plaque above the Front Hall is inscribed in both Chinese and Manchu. Sadly this hall, as well as the Middle Hall and Rear Hall behind, is inaccessible. The northern perimeter of the park abuts the palace moat, where you can find a bench and park yourself in front of a fine view. For an offbeat experience, practise your backhand within a ball's bounce of the Forbidden City at the Royal Tennis Centre , near the park's east gate. There's also a south gate, for Tiān'ānmén Sq, and a northwest gate, for the Forbidden City.	90	116.394085	39.908304	4.5	21	18	3	0	0	4.5	['6:30 - 19:30', '30:30 - 43:30', '54:30 - 67:30', '78:30 - 91:30', '102:30 - 115:30', '126:30 - 139:30', '150:30 - 163:30']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Civic Centers', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	CCTV Building	Shaped like an enormous pair of trousers, and known locally as Dà Kùchǎ (大裤衩), or Big Underpants, the astonishing CCTV Tower is an architectural fantasy that appears to defy gravity. It's made possible by an unusual engineering design which creates a three-dimensional cranked loop, supported by an irregular grid on its surface. Designed by Rem Koolhaas and Ole Scheeren, the building is an audacious statement of modernity (despite its nickname) and a unique addition to the Běijīng skyline.Unfortunately, there's no access to the site, unless you can score a visitors pass from someone who works there, and the armed police who guard the gates lack a sense of humour. The strict security is partly a result of a February 2008 fire caused by stray fireworks from CCTV’s own Lantern Festival celebration, which sent the costly Television Cultural Center in the north of the complex up in flames. Despite burning for five hours with spectacular ferocity, none of this was shown on TV, with CCTV famously censoring its reporting of the huge conflagration (Běijīng netizens dryly noted how CCTV created one of the year’s biggest stories only to not cover it). The Běijīng Mandarin Oriental, a visitor’s centre and theatre were also destroyed in the blaze, but Big Underpants itself escaped unsinged.	90	116.456301	39.912847	5.0	20	22	11	0	0	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Imperial City Exhibition	Substantial portions of Běijīng survive solely in a twilight world of fading nostalgia. This fascinating museum is devoted to the Imperial City (Huáng Chéng), which – beyond its fragmented constituent parts – exists largely in name alone. The museum is within the Changpu River Park (Chāngpú Hé Gōngyuán), a delightful, if contrived, formula of marble bridges, rock features, paths, a stream, willows, magnolias, scholar and walnut trees north of Dongchang’an Jie. The museum functions as a memorial to the demolished imperial wall, gates and buildings of the Imperial City. A diorama in the museum reveals the full extent of the yellow-tiled Imperial City Wall, which encompassed a vast chunk of Běijīng nearly seven times the size of the Forbidden City. In its heyday, 28 large temples could be found in the Imperial City alone, along with many smaller shrines. Period photos of the old gates of Běijīng and images of the halls and pavilions in Zhōngnánhǎi are hung on the walls. Further galleries have exhibits of imperial ornaments such as ruyi (sceptres), porcelain and enamelware, and the weapons and armour of the imperial guards.		116.395447254	39.9074977414	None							[]	['City Tours', 'Tours & Activities']	False	activity
china	beijing	Ming City Wall Ruins Park	This slice of restored Ming Inner City Wall runs along the length of the northern flank of Chongwenmen Dongdajie and is attached to a slender strip of park. It's all that is left of the original 24km-long city wall, which started being demolished in the 1960s to make room for new roads and the subway system.The wall stretches from the former site of Chóngwén Mén (崇文门; Chóngwén Gate), one of the nine gates of the Inner City Wall, to the Southeast Corner Watchtower and then turns north for a short distance along Jianguomen Nandajie to Beijingzhan Dongjie. Chóngwén Mén was also called Shuì Mén (税门; Tax Gate) as the capital tax bureau lay just outside the gate. You can walk the park’s length, taking in its higgledy-piggledy contours and the interior layers of stone in parts of the wall that have collapsed. The restored sections run for just over 2km, rising to a height of around 15m and interrupted every 80m with buttresses extending to a maximum depth of 39m. The most interesting sections of wall are those closer to their original and more dilapidated state and some of the bricks come complete with bullet holes.	90	116.420453271	39.8995993358	4.0	10	16	7	0	0	4.0	['8:00 - 17:00', '32:00 - 41:00', '56:00 - 65:00', '80:00 - 89:00', '104:00 - 113:00', '128:00 - 137:00', '152:00 - 161:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Chairman Mao Memorial Hall	Mao Zedong died in September 1976 and his memorial hall was constructed on the southern side of Tiān’ānmén Sq soon afterwards. This squat, Soviet-inspired mausoleum lies on Běijīng’s north–south axis of symmetry on the footprint of Zhōnghuá Gate (Zhōnghuá Mén), a vast and ancient portal flattened during the communist development of Tiān’ānmén Sq. Mao is still revered across much of China, and you’ll see some people reduced to tears here at the sight of his mummified corpse.It lies in a crystal cabinet, draped in an anachronistic red flag emblazoned with hammer and sickle, as guards in white gloves impatiently wave visitors on towards further rooms, where a riot of Mao kitsch – lighters, bracelets, statues, key rings, bottle openers, you name it – ensues.Bags and cameras need to be deposited at the building east of the memorial hall across the road from Tiān’ānmén Sq. And don’t forget your passport. You won’t be let into the hall without it. Note, the queues may seem impossibly long, but they are constantly moving (visitors aren't allowed to stop inside the hall), so go down relatively quickly.	90	116.391327824	39.9011518862	4.0	52	75	34	17	7	4.0	['7:00 - 11:00', '55:00 - 59:00', '79:00 - 83:00', '103:00 - 107:00', '127:00 - 131:00', '151:00 - 155:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Front Gate	Front Gate actually consists of two gates. The northernmost is the 40m-high Zhèngyáng Gate (正阳门城楼; Zhèngyáng Mén Chénglóu), which dates from the Ming dynasty and which was the largest of the nine gates of the Inner City Wall separating the inner, or Tartar (Manchu) city from the outer, or Chinese city. With the disappearance of the city walls, the gate sits out of context, but it can be climbed for decent views of the square and of Arrow Tower, immediately to the south.Partially destroyed in the Boxer Rebellion around 1900, the gate was once flanked by two temples that have since vanished. Inside the upper levels are some fascinating historical photographs , showing the area as it was at the beginning of the last century, before the city walls and many of the surrounding gates and temples were demolished. Explanatory captions are in English as well as Chinese.Zhèngyáng Gate Arrow Tower , directly south, can’t be climbed. It also dates from the Ming dynasty and was originally connected to Zhèngyáng Gate by a semicircular enceinte (demolished last century).	90	116.391644918	39.8990392991	5.0	32	63	20	5	1	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Gate of Heavenly Peace	Hung with a vast likeness of Mao Zedong, and guarded by two pairs of Ming stone lions, the double-eaved Gate of Heavenly Peace, north of Tiān’ānmén Square , is a potent national symbol. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, the gate was formerly the largest of the four gates of the Imperial City Wall, and it was from this gate that Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on 1 October 1949. Today’s political coterie watches mass troop parades from here.Climb the gate for excellent views of the square, and peek inside at the impressive beams and overdone paintwork; in all there are 60 gargantuan wooden pillars and 17 vast lamps suspended from the ceiling. Within the gate tower there is also a fascinating photographic history of the gate and Tiān’ānmén Square, although captions are in Chinese only.There’s no fee for walking through the gate, en route to the Forbidden City, but if you climb it you’ll have to pay. The ticket office is on the north side of the gate. For Forbidden City tickets , keep walking about 600m further north.	90	116.391199	39.907341	5.5	335	248	103	12	4	4.5	['5:00 - 22:00', '29:00 - 46:00', '53:00 - 70:00', '77:00 - 94:00', '101:00 - 118:00', '125:00 - 142:00', '149:00 - 166:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Great Bell Temple	Newly refurbished, this famous shrine (originally called Juéshēng Temple) was once a pit stop for Qing emperors who came here to pray for rain. Today the temple is named after its massive Ming-dynasty bell (6.75m tall and weighing a hefty 46.5 tonnes), which is inscribed with Buddhist sutras, comprising more than 227,000 Chinese characters, and decorated with Sanskrit incantations.The bell was cast during the reign of Emperor Yongle in 1406, with the tower built in 1733. To transport the bell from the foundry to the temple, a shallow canal was dug, and when it froze over in winter the bell was shunted across the ice by sled. Nowadays, the bell is rung just once a year, on Lunar New Year's Eve.If you’re bell crazy, you’ll be spellbound by the exhibitions on bell casting, and the collection of bells from France, Russia, Japan, Korea and other nations. Also on view are copies of the bells and chimes of the Marquis of Zeng and a collection of Buddhist and Taoist bells, including vajra bells and the wind chimes hung from temple roofs and pagodas	120	116.331975	39.966563	3.5	1	5	4	0	1	3.5	['8:24 - 16:33', '32:24 - 40:33', '56:24 - 64:33', '80:24 - 88:33', '104:24 - 112:33', '128:24 - 136:33', '152:24 - 160:33']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
china	beijing	Clock Exhibition Hall	The Clock Exhibition Hall is one of the unmissable highlights of the Forbidden City. Located in the Hall for Ancestral Worship (Fèngxiàn Diàn) – just off to the right after the Three Great Halls – the exhibition contains an astonishing array of elaborate timepieces, many of which were gifts to the Qing emperors from overseas. Many of the 18th-century examples are crafted by James Cox or Joseph Williamson (both of London) and imported through Guǎngdōng from England; others are from Switzerland, America and Japan. Exquisitely wrought and fashioned with magnificently designed elephants and other creatures, they all display astonishing artfulness and attention to detail. Standout clocks include the ‘Gilt Copper Astronomy Clock’ equipped with a working model of the solar system, and the automaton-equipped ‘Gilt Copper Clock with a robot writing Chinese characters with a brush’. Time your arrival for 11am or 2pm to see the clock performance in which choice timepieces strike the hour and give a display to wide-eyed children and adults.	90	116.393065	39.917505	4.0	12	9	6	2	0	4.0	['9:00 - 16:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']	['Government Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Check out the intricate scaling on the ‘Zūn vessel in the shape of a Phoenix’ (倗季凤鸟尊) or the ‘Yǒu with Divine Faces’ (神面卣), with its elephant head on the side of the vessel. The detailed animist patterns on the Gangbo You (棡柏卣) are similarly vivid and fascinating.In an attached room are four of the Western-styled 12 bronze animals plundered with the sacking of the Old Summer Palace that have been acquired by the museum; pig, monkey, tiger and ox. The last room is populated with a wonderful collection of standing Bodhisattva statues, dating from the Northern Qi, Northern Wei and Tang dynasties.Those interested in Ming-dynasty architecture should check out the nearby Imperial Granaries . Nine of the storehouses, dating from 1409, have been lovingly restored. They once contained grain and rice for Běijīng’s royalty; they now house posh wine bars and members clubs.	120	116.426762797	39.9317255498	4.0	8	7	1	0	1	4.0	['33:30 - 40:30', '57:30 - 64:30', '81:30 - 88:30', '105:30 - 112:30', '129:30 - 136:30', '153:30 - 160:30']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
china	beijing	National Museum of China	Běijīng’s premier museum is housed in an immense 1950s building on the eastern side of Tiān’ānmén Sq, and is well worth visiting. The Ancient China exhibition on the basement floor is outstanding. You could easily spend a couple of hours in this exhibition alone. It contains dozens and dozens of stunning pieces, from prehistoric China through to the Qing Dynasty, all displayed beautifully in modern, spacious, low-lit exhibition halls.Look out for the 2000-year-old jade burial suit, made for the clearly well-endowed Western Han Dynasty king Liu Xiu, and the life-sized bronze acupuncture statue, dating from the 15th century. The 2000-year-old rhino-shaped bronze zūn (wine vessel) is another stand-out piece. The Ancient Chinese Money exhibition on the top floor, and the Bronze Art and Buddhist Sculpture galleries, one floor below, are also worth seeing.The museum, which is vast and energy-sapping, also has a ground-floor cafe (south end) and a teahouse (north end). Note, you must bring your passport along to gain museum entry.	150	116.395000644	39.9039510177	5.5	201	137	54	6	6	4.5	['9:00 - 17:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00', '153:00 - 161:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
china	beijing	Ancient Observatory	This unusual former observatory is mounted on the battlements of a watchtower lying along the line of the old Ming City Wall and originally dates back to Kublai Khan’s days, when it lay north of the present site. Kublai, like later Ming and Qing emperors, relied heavily on astrologers to plan military endeavours. The present observatory – the only surviving example of several constructed during the Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties – was built between 1437 and 1446 to facilitate both astrological predictions and seafaring navigation.At ground level is a pleasant courtyard flanked by halls housing displays (with limited English captions). Also within the courtyard is an armillary sphere dating to 1439, supported by four dragons.Clamber the steps to the roof of the watchtower to admire a mind-boggling array of Jesuit-designed astronomical instruments, embellished with sculptured bronze dragons and other Chinese flourishes – a kind of East and West astronomical fusion.	90	116.428314181	39.9066799726	4.0	14	17	8	0	0	4.0	[]	['Observatories & Planetariums', 'Historic Sites', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Today, many of the altar's original structures survive and make up a tranquil and little-visited constellation of relics.

The giant former factory workshops are ideally suited to multimedia installations and other ambitious projects.You could easily spend half a day wandering around the complex. There are signboards with English-language maps to guide you around.Highlights include BTAP , one of 798's original galleries; UCCA , a big-money gallery with exhibition halls, a funky shop and a cinema screening films most days; Pace , a wonderfully large space holding some top-quality exhibitions; Galleria Continua , another giant space, below a towering, hard-to-miss brick chimney.	90	116.4839489	39.98446258	5.5	644	440	100	26	7	4.5	[]	['Art Galleries', 'Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums', 'Shopping']	True	activity
china	beijing	Bird’s Nest & Water Cube	Seven years after the 2008 Olympics, walking around the Olympic Sports Centre midweek is rather like being stuck in a district of Brasilia or one of those zombie movies where humans have all but been wiped out. A few events are staged at the signature National Stadium, known colloquially as the Bird’s Nest (鸟巢; Niǎocháo), but it mostly stands empty and security staff and optimistic street vendors outnumber visitors. Nevertheless, it remains an iconic, if forlorn, piece of architecture.Such, though, is the fate of most Olympics projects after the event and the Bird's Nest has fared better than many of the other venues for the 2008 Olympics, some of which are now no more than decaying structures surrounded by wasteland. The neighbouring, bubble-covered Water Cube is worth a look too, and now houses the Happy Magic Water Park .

Today, the alley is an insatiably bubbly strip of bars, wi-fi cafes, restaurants, hotels and trendy shops.It is also a victim of its own success, though. Come here on a summer weekend to experience more people than you thought could possibly fit onto one street! With that in mind, don’t miss exploring the quieter alleys, which fan out from the main lane and house Qing-dynasty courtyards as well as hidden cafes, shops, restaurants and bars. 	90	116.396874	39.932446	5.0	361	411	107	19	14	4.0	[]	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Shopping']	True	activity

Mao Dun joined the League of Left Wing Writers in 1930, becoming solidly entrenched in the bureaucracy after the communists came to power. He lay low during the Cultural Revolution, but briefly returned to writing in the 1970s. His best-known works are Spring Silkworms (1932) and Midnight (1934).

Born in Shàoxīng in Zhèjiāng province and buried in Shànghǎi, he lived in Běijīng for over a decade. As a writer, Lu Xun, who first trained in medicine, articulated a deep yearning for reform by mercilessly exposing the foibles of the Chinese character in such tales as Medicine and Diary of a Madman . The modern two-storey museum here depicts his life in great detail.The exhibits are well presented and come with English captions.

It was, when it was built, the tallest structure in Dàdū (the Yuan-dynasty name for Běijīng), and even today it is the tallest Tibetan-style pagoda in China.The temple has been under extensive renovation for some years, and was still closed at the time of research, but previous highlights of a visit here included the diverse collection of Buddhist statuary: the Hall of the Great Enlightened One (大觉宝殿; Dàjué Bǎodiàn), for example, glittered splendidly with hundreds of Tibetan Buddhist effigies. After you finish here, exit the temple and wander the tangle of local alleyways for street-market action and earthy shades of hútòng life.	90	116.356909	39.922606	4.0	9	7	3	0	1	4.0	['9:00 - 16:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Běijīng Police Museum	Propaganda aside, riveting exhibits make this a fascinating exposé of Běijīng’s dà gài mào (local slang for the constabulary). Learn how Běijīng’s first Public Security Bureau (PSB) college operated from the Dōngyuè Temple in 1949 and find out how officers tackled the ‘stragglers, disbanded soldiers, bandits, local ruffians, hoodlums and despots…’ planted in Běijīng by the Kuomintang (KMT).There are also eye-opening accounts of how KMT spies Li Andong and Yamaguchi Takachi planned to mortar the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and a welcome analysis of how the Běijīng PSB was destroyed during the ‘national catastrophe’ of the Cultural Revolution. For police weapons, head to the 4th floor. The through ticket includes some laser-shooting practice and a souvenir.	120	116.397936318	39.9005178918	3.5	1	2	3	0	0	3.5	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
china	beijing	Rìtán Park	Meaning ‘Altar of the Sun’, Rìtán (pronounced 'rer-tan') is a real oasis in the heart of Běijīng's business district. Dating back to 1530 and one of a set of imperial parks which covered each compass point – others include the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth (Dìtán Park) – the altar is now little more than a raised platform. But the surrounding park is beautifully landscaped and a great place to tune out from the surrounding mayhem.Activities include dancing, singing, kite flying, rock-climbing (¥25 per hour or ¥60 per day), table tennis and pond fishing (¥5 per hour). Otherwise, just stroll around and enjoy the flora, or head to one of the park’s cafes; the standout one is Stone Boat , located by a large pond artfully strewn with rocks.	90	None	None	5.5	58	49	14	0	0	4.5	[]	['Nature & Parks']	True	activity
china	beijing	Wudaoying Hutong	Following the huge success of the Nanluogu Xiang renovation project, Wudaoying Hutong was given a massive facelift a couple of years back, and this once residential back alley is now another wannabe trendy lane packed with wi-fi cafes, cute restaurants, boutique shops and a couple of bars. It’s nowhere near as popular as Nanluogu Xiang, but there are some standout places that are worth a visit: Veggie Table , Běijīng’s first vegan restaurant; Natooke , the capital’s coolest bike shop; and Vineyard Café , every expat’s favourite brunch stop. There’s also the unusual Change , a tiny secondhand ‘swap shop’, where you can trade in your old stuff for whatever takes your fancy.

china	beijing	Great Hall of the People	On the western side of Tiān’ānmén Sq, on a site previously occupied by Taichang Temple, the Jinyiwei (Ming-dynasty secret service) and the Ministry of Justice, the Great Hall of the People is the venue of the legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC). The 1959 architecture is monolithic and intimidating, and a fitting symbol of China’s huge bureaucracy.Inside you can peek into 29 of its lifeless rooms named after the provinces of the Chinese universe. Also here is the banquet room where US president Richard Nixon dined in 1972, and the 10,000-seat auditorium with the familiar red star embedded in a galaxy of ceiling lights. The ticket office is down the south side of the building.

china	beijing	Hóng Lóu	Built in 1918, this red-brick building was the former library and arts department of Peking University (北大; Běidà), and Mao Zedong worked here as a librarian from 1918 to 1919 before forming north China’s first Communist Party here. It was also from here that he and his comrades helped launch the 1919 May Fourth Movement, after which the main road here is named; Wusi means 'five-four'. The ground floor of the main building now forms the New Culture Movement Museum (新文化运动纪念馆; Xīnwénhuà Yùndòng Jìniànguǎn), which commemorates the movement. The registration room contains the desk Mao used to work from, and you can also see the office of Li Dazhao, the library administrator who apparently introduced Mao to books on Marxism.		116.398344	39.923009	None							[]	[]		activity
china	beijing	Qi Baishi's Former Residence	Known for the whimsical, often playful style of his watercolors, Qi Baishi (1864-1957) was an influential Chinese painter who lived in Běijīng from 1917 onwards. This particular courtyard residence – built on the site of the Qing-dynasty home of Emperor Hong Taiji's fourth son, Ye Bushu (1627–1690) – was his home for just the final two years of his life. Rooms here contain numerous examples of his scroll paintings, and one includes a detailed introduction (with English translations) to his life story.The courtyard also makes a pleasant spot for a cuppa. There's no cafe as such, but there are tables and chairs scattered around, and the drinks menu (also in English) includes good-value tea (¥10 to ¥20) and coffee (¥15).	90	116.394364	39.934256	4.5	1	3	0	0	0	4.5	['9:07 - 17:02', '33:07 - 41:02', '57:07 - 65:02', '81:07 - 89:02', '105:07 - 113:02', '129:07 - 137:02', '153:07 - 161:02']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
china	beijing	Lao She Museum	Brimful of uncomplicated charm, this renovated courtyard house off Dengshikou Xijie was the home of Lao She (1899–1966), one of Běijīng’s best-loved 20th-century writers. The life of Lao She – author of Rickshaw Boy and Tea House, and former teacher at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies – is detailed in a modest collection of halls, via newspaper cuttings, first-edition books, photographs and personal effects.The exhibition falls at the final hurdle, giving perfunctory mention to perhaps the most significant aspect of Lao She’s life: his death by drowning in Taiping Lake on 24 August 1966 after a nasty beating by vituperative Red Guards the day before.

china	beijing	St Joseph’s Church	A crowning edifice on Wangfujing Dajie, and one of Běijīng’s four principal churches, St Joseph’s is known locally as Dōng Táng (East Cathedral). Originally built during the reign of Shunzhi in 1655, it was damaged by an earthquake in 1720 and reconstructed. The luckless church also caught fire in 1807, was destroyed again in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion and restored in 1904, only to be shut in 1966. Now fully repaired, the church is a testament to the long history of Christianity in China.A large piazza in front swarms with kids skate-boarding, newlyweds posing for photographs and elderly folk meeting up in the early evening for formation dancing.

Look out for the Building for Observing the Moon (望月楼; Wàngyuèlóu), from where the lunar calendar was calculated.The mosque blends traditional Chinese temple design with Middle Eastern flourishes – note the spirit wall on Nui Jie that guards the entrance, a feature of all Chinese temples regardless of denomination.

Before being razed, the gate, Dōng’ān Mén, was a single-eaved, seven-bay-wide building with a hip-and-gable roof capped with yellow tiles. All that's left of it now are two layers of 18 bricks.	90	116.400602543	39.9139600047	4.0	920	985	601	91	39	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

The food is imperial cuisine, but with a heavy Shāndōng influence (the original chef was from Shāndōng province), so there is some crossover in dishes. All are very well done, though. The menu is in English. Specialities include: sauteed tofu with ham and pea, braised chicken in chilli sauce, and a dish called 'the fifth pot', which is a pork and vegetable stew.

china	beijing	Ghost Street	For a close-up look at how Beijingers treat their restaurants as party venues and not just places for a meal, take a trip to Ghost Street. This 1.4km strip of Dongzhimennei Dajie is home to over 150 restaurants that attract everyone from hipsters to office workers, man-bag-toting businessmen and families, as well as the odd celebrity. It never closes, making it one of Běijīng’s most buzzing streets, and it’s especially fun on Friday and Saturday nights. Traffic slows to a crawl as the restaurant workers line the side of the road trying to entice passing cars to stop at their joint. Crowds of people spill out onto the pavement waiting for a free table, while inside the packed restaurants the sweating staff rush around delivering food and beers to people celebrating the end of the week.Most styles of Chinese cuisine are represented on Ghost Street, but it’s best known for its hotpot and spicy seafood restaurants.The giant Xiǎo Yú Shān is always jammed with people cracking open crayfish and shrimp. For classic Mongolian hotpot, try Little Sheep , which sources its mutton from Inner Mongolia. For the spicier, Sìchuān version of hotpot, cross the road to Chóngqìng Kǒngliàng Huǒguō .Ghost Street gets its English name from a mis-translation for the Chinese nickname of the street, Gui Jie (簋街). 簋 (pronounced 'guǐ') is an ancient bronze food vessel, a statue of which you can find at the far eastern end of Dongzhimennei Dajie, by the 2nd Ring Rd, but it’s pronounced the same as 鬼 – Chinese for ghost.Sadly its signature red lanterns, which for years lined both sides of the street, lending it a unique look, were torn down by overzealous local officials in 2014 – they were a fire risk, apparently.		116.413196274	39.9395596954	None							[]	[]		restaurant
china	beijing	Grandma's	Handy for shoppers on Wangfujing Dajie, but worth making the trip to from any part of the city, the Běijīng branch of this hugely successful Hángzhōu chain is a big hit in the capital. It's excellent value and is clean and bright, with comfy booth seating, so very popular with families. The menu is in English, although you might need a magnifying glass to read it.Dishes we heartily recommend include Grandma's Pork (a juicy, braised pork dish, known in Hángzhōu as Dōngpō ròu ; 东坡肉), Tea Flavoured Chicken (cooked with Hángzhōu's famous Lóngjǐng green tea), Potatoes on a Sizzling Iron Plate, the Grilled Eggplant and the Organic Cauliflour. But anything with a red thumbs-up icon next to it on the menu is a safe bet.This place is so popular you usually have to wait at least an hour for a table. You can't reserve in advance; you have to come to the entrance and take a ticket (like in a bank). As you do so, you need to enter your details on the touch screen. In the first box, enter your mobile telephone number. In the second box, enter the number of people there are in your group. Then click on the left-hand red button that reads: 领号 (meaning, receive a number), and take your ticket. Armed with your mobile number, the restaurant will then text you about five minutes before your table is ready. If you don't have a local phone, you'll have to keep coming back to check what number they're up to. Expect to wait an hour on midweek evenings; two hours at weekends. Lunchtimes are less busy. Grandma's is on the 6th floor of the modern shopping mall known in English as 'Beijing apm'; the one with the massive Apple store on the ground floor.		116.405189	39.913909	5.5	45	36	10	2	0	4.5	[]	[]	True	restaurant
china	beijing	Yáng Fāng Lamb Hotpot	There are two main types of hotpot in China: the ridiculously spicy one that comes from the fire-breathing southwestern city of Chóngqìng, and the milder version which is cooked in an unusual conical brass pot and which originally hails from Mongolia, but has been adopted as a Běijīng speciality. Yáng Fāng is a salt-of-the-earth version of the latter, and is a real favourite with the locals round here.First order the broth you want in your pot – clear (清汤锅底; qīng tāng guōde; ¥8), or spicy (辣锅底; là guōde; ¥15); clear is more common. Then ask for some sesame-paste dipping sauce (小料; xiǎo liào; ¥5); each person should have one. And, if you fancy it, order some freshly prepared chilli oil (鲜榨辣椒油; xiān zhá là jiāo yóu; ¥2) to mix into your dipping sauce; one bowl is enough for everyone to share.Finally, select the raw ingredients you want to cook in your broth.

china	beijing	Zhāng Māma	The original Zhāng Māma, on nearby Fensiting Hutong, was such a hit with Beijingers they were forced to also open this new, larger branch with two floors. At the smaller, original branch you have to wait up to an hour for a table. Here, they've cut that down to about 15 minutes. It's worth the wait. This is arguably Běijīng's best-value Sichuanese restaurant.The speciality is málà xiāngguō (麻辣香锅; ¥48 to ¥58), a fiery, chilli-laced broth with either chicken (香锅鸡; xiāngguō jī ), prawns (香锅虾; xiāngguō xiā ) or ribs (香锅排骨; xiāngguō páigǔ ) simmering away inside, and with a variety of vegetables added into the mix. One pot is enough for two or three people. Also worth trying here is the dàndàn miàn (担担面; spicy dry noodles; ¥8) and the rice meals; the classic being the gōngbào jīdīng gàifàn (宫爆鸡丁盖饭; spicy chicken with peanuts; ¥12), which is lip-tinglingly delicious, thanks to the generous sprinkling of Sìchuān peppercorns. No English menu, so don't be shy about pointing to what fellow diners are eating. Chances are it'll be spicy, but delicious.		116.402582	39.936708	3.5						3.5	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Bàodǔ Huáng	Be prepared to queue at this no-nonsense apartment-block restaurant (look for the green sign with four yellow characters), where locals gobble and slurp their way through the authentic Běijīng-grub menu. The speciality is bàodǔ (爆肚; boiled lamb tripe; ¥18 or ¥35 depending on portion size). If you can't stomach that, then plump instead for a delicious niúròu dàcóng ròubǐng (牛肉大葱肉饼; beef and onion fried patty; ¥8).The blanched vegetables are popular side dishes; choose from chāo báicài (焯白菜; blanched cabbage; ¥6), chāo fěnsī (焯粉丝; blanched glass noodles; ¥6) or chāo dòng dòufu (焯冻豆腐; blanched tofu; ¥6). And if you haven’t ordered a meat patty, grab a zhīma shāobing (芝麻烧饼; roasted sesame-seed bun; ¥1.5) instead. True Beijingers will also nibble on jiāo quān (焦圈; deep-fried dough rings; ¥1), washed down with gulps of dòu zhī (豆汁; sour soy milk). But you may prefer to go for a bottle of píjǐu (啤酒; local beer; ¥5). No English spoken, no English menu, no English sign.		116.433481	39.93985	4.0						4.0	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Yuèbīn Fànguǎn	Post-1949, this was the first privately owned restaurant to open in Běijīng. It's so minimalist that it still has an old canteen-like feel to it, but the focus here, as with many of China's best restaurants, is on the food, not the decor. This is a proper locals joint, so ignore the cigarette smoking and the fish-bone spitting, pull up a chair, order a bottle of Yanjing beer (燕京啤酒; Yānjīng píjiǔ ), and tuck in.The menu, naturally, is in Chinese only. House specialities include: guōshāo yā (锅烧鸭; fried duck – the first dish ever served here, apparently), suànní zhǒuzi (蒜泥肘子; pork shoulder in garlic and vinegar), miànjīn pá báicài (面筋扒白菜; glutinous braised cabbage), qīngchǎo xiārén (清炒虾仁; stir-fried shrimp) and wǔ sī tǒng (五丝筒; chicken-and-veg egg rolls, served with pancakes, leeks and hoisin sauce). Note, check how much your beer costs before they open it for you. Some are cheap, but some cost almost ¥20 a bottle.		116.401262	39.922458	4.5	4	2	0	0	0	4.5	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Kǒng Yǐjǐ	Shàoxīng in Zhèjiāng province is famous as the birthplace of Lu Xun, the man who invented modern Chinese literature, and its eponymous, sherry-like wine. So it’s entirely appropriate that this restaurant, which takes its name from an alcoholic character in one of Lu’s stories, serves some dishes – such as drunken shrimp (醉虾; zuìxiā ) and drunken chicken (醉鸡; zuìjī ) – swimming in Shàoxīng wine. Rest assured it tastes better than báijiǔ (white spirit). Also popular at this big and bustling place, with a fine outdoor area, at the northwestern edge of the Hòuhǎi lakes are the many alcohol-free pork and fish dishes, such as the very addictive dōngpō ròu (东坡肉). No English or picture menu; take a look at what other people are eating and point. Despite the address, the restaurant is actually by the Hòuhǎi lakeshore. To get here, turn down narrow Dongming Hútòng from Deshengmen Dajie and then right at the end of the lane.		116.374920668	39.9415869011	4.5	8	15	0	1	0	4.5	[]	[]	False	restaurant

Often they’re the most authentic places for regional cuisines. This restaurant in the Sìchuān Government Offices is always crowded and serves up just about every variety of Sìchuān food you could want.It’s very much a place for fire fiends: almost every dish comes loaded with chillies and mouth-numbing Sìchuān peppercorns, whether it’s bamboo shoots, Sìchuān specials such as làzi jī (here called 'young chicken Chongqing style'), or steamed fish with pepper and taro (here called 'boiled fish in spicy and hot pepper'). There are also dishes with rabbit and frog; both regional delicacies. There’s an English menu with photos, but no English sign; it’s housed in an office-block of a building, with the entrance round the back.		116.425552	39.910493	4.0	18	27	5	0	2	4.0	['11:00 - 14:00', '35:00 - 38:00', '59:00 - 62:00', '83:00 - 86:00', '107:00 - 110:00', '131:00 - 134:00', '155:00 - 158:00', '17:00 - 21:00', '41:00 - 45:00', '65:00 - 69:00', '89:00 - 93:00', '113:00 - 117:00', '137:00 - 141:00', '161:00 - 165:00']	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Guǎnshì Chìbā	Informal, brightly lit, noisy and fun, this grilled-skewers joint makes a great lunchtime pitstop, or no-nonsense evening meal, after a tour of Běihǎi Park or the Hóuhǎi Lakes.The house speciality is chicken wings (鸡翅, jī chì ), which are cooked using a secret recipe (秘制, mì zhì ). The lamb skewers (羊肉串; yángròuchuàn ) are also delicious and the lightly grilled baked-bread slices (馒头片; mántou piàn ) are perfect for dipping into one of the soups; the noodle-drop soup (疙瘩汤; gēda tāng ) is our favourite, and is enough for four people to share. No English menu. Instead you'll have to fill in the Chinese tick-box menu. Other grilled skewers to look for include: 烤尖椒 (kǎo jiānjiāo; green chilli peppers), 烤茄子 (kǎo qiézi; aubergine) and 烤大蒜 (kǎo dàsuàn; garlic). Don't forget to tick what spice level you want: 不辣 (bù là; low spice) or 微辣 (wēi là; medium spice).		116.386596	39.931837	None							[]	[]		restaurant
china	beijing	La Marée	Hard to find (it’s inside CBD International Mansions, down a road off Jianguomenwai Dajie very close to exit C of Yonganli Station), this southern-French seafood restaurant is one of the nicest international restaurants in town. The dining room is decorated in maritime blue, with fishing nets strung across the ceiling, while the French chef gives a modern spin to traditional seafood dishes using both local and imported ingredients (there are also meat dishes that use beef from Australia). The splendid seafood platter for two (Y498) is a good introduction. Otherwise, mains start at Y125. Thankfully, it also does a more affordable lunch deal, where you pay Y48 for a soup and salad bar and then up to Y50 for a main course. There are 200 French wines available, starting at Y198 a bottle and going up to Y56,000 for really big spenders.		116.445827	39.90393576	None							[]	[]		restaurant
china	beijing	Brian McKenna @ The Courtyard	This 10-year-old classic of the Běijīng fine-dining scene has been given a new lease of life by UK-born chef Brian McKenna. Courtyard still enjoys its peerless location, housed in a Qing-dynasty building beside the Forbidden City moat, but McKenna has revamped the interior (there are more tables with a view of the moat now) and the menu (with some inovative new creations, such as his chocolate terracotta warrior).The basement art gallery has been transformed into a classy cigar bar – head down here for an aperitif before your meal. Reservations are recommended, especailly if you want a table overlooking the moat (the walls beside it are lit up in the evening). There are a number of set menus (ranging from ¥588 to ¥1488), including a five-course vegetarian set menu, but à la carte is also available, as are wine pairings.		116.396263	39.913917	3.5	21	4	5	9	4	3.5	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Zuǒ Lín Yòu Shè	This small, no-frills restaurant focuses on Běijīng cuisine. The speciality is dālian huǒshāo (褡裢火烧), golden-fried finger-shaped dumplings stuffed with all manner of savoury fillings; we prefer the pork ones, but there are lamb, beef and veggie choices too. They are served by the liǎng (两), with one liǎng equal to three dumplings, and they prefer you to order at least two liǎng (二两; èr liǎng ) of each filling to make it worth their while cooking a batch.Other specialities include the pickled fish (酥鲫鱼; sū jì yú ), the spicy tofu paste (麻豆腐; má dòufu ) and the deep-fried pork balls (干炸丸子; gān zhá wánzi ), while filling bowls of millet porridge (小米粥; xiǎo mǐ zhōu ) are served up for free.

It has an English menu, including grilled skewers, lamb dishes and noodles, and is basic but clean. Further on is a smaller, older branch, which specialises in boiled tripe (爆肚; bàodǔ ) and has an adjacent takeaway-dumplings stall, which is very popular at breakfast time: try the beef and onion dumplings (牛肉大葱包子; niúròu dàcōng bāozi; ¥2 each). They also roast very good sesame-seed buns (烧饼; shāobing; ¥1 each), which you can have filled with lamb (烧饼夹肉; shāobing jiā ròu; ¥7 each).		116.386553	39.938526	None							[]	[]		restaurant
china	beijing	Dōnghuámén Night Market	A sight in itself, the bustling night market near Wangfujing Dajie is a veritable food zoo: lamb, beef and chicken skewers, corn on the cob, smelly dòufu (tofu), cicadas, grasshoppers, kidneys, quail eggs, snake, squid, fruit, porridge, fried pancakes, strawberry kebabs, bananas, Inner Mongolian cheese, stuffed eggplants, chicken hearts, pita bread stuffed with meat, shrimps – and that’s just the start.It’s not a very authentic Běijīng experience, but the vendors take great glee in persuading foreigners to try such delicacies as scorpion on a stick. Expect to pay ¥5 for a lamb skewer; more than you would pay for the same snack from a hútòng vendor. More exotic skewers cost up to ¥50. Noodles or savoury pancakes (jiānbing ) will set you back about ¥10. Prices are all marked and in English.		116.402711	39.914172	3.5	31	42	30	11	6	3.5	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Róng Tiān Sheep Spine	Rough-and-ready locals' favourite serving mouthwateringly good sheep-spine hotpot. Order your sheep-spine chunks (普通羊蝎子; pǔtōng yángxiēzi ) by the jīn (500g). Two jins ' worth (二斤; èr jīn ) is normally about right. They will then come ready-cooked in a boiling broth – the longer you leave them to simmer, the juicier they get. You then add other raw ingredients to cook in the broth like a standard Chinese hotpot.Our favourite extras include sweet potato (红薯; hóng shǔ ), tofu blocks (鲜豆腐; xiān dòufu ), mushrooms (木耳; mù’ěr ), Oriental raddish (白萝卜; bái luóbo ) and Chinese spinach (油麦菜; yóu mài cài ). Complimentary fresh noodles are thrown in at the end, to soak up the juices. When you’re ready for them, say ‘fàng miàn’ (put the noodles in).

china	beijing	Tiāndì Yījiā	Doing business from a restored building alongside Chāngpú River Park (Chāngpú Hé Gōngyuán), this refined, Chinese courtyard-style restaurant is notable for the water feature with multicoloured fish that dominates the elegant dining room. There’s also a balcony overlooking the former Imperial Archives (Huángshǐ Chéng). The menu, which spans a number of provinces and styles, is strong on seafood with snob appeal – shark’s fin, abalone and lobster – as well as traditional delicacies such as bird’s-nest soup and local faves such as Peking duck (¥280). It also does dim sum. The wine list (from ¥450) is hugely impressive, with a number of vintage bottles. The only downside is the slightly stiff atmosphere, not helped by the black-clad waitresses, who are hardly a bundle of laughs.		116.397218	39.907547	None							[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Mǎn Fú Lóu	This grand-looking but inexpensive 20-year-old hotpot restaurant serves up Mongolian hotpot – the nonspicy, lamb-based version which hails from the steppes, but has been adopted as a Běijīng speciality. Here each diner gets their own, mini, conical brass pot in which to boil their food. Choose the clear broth (qīng tāng; 清汤; ¥12), which isn't spicy, then pick portions of raw ingredients from the menu (in English and with photos).Each person should also order a small bowl of sesame-paste dipping sauce (小料; xiǎo liào ), which you dip your cooked food into before eating it. There should be a pot of chilli oil (辣椒油; làjiāo yóu ) on your table (if not, ask for it), which can be mixed into the sesame paste to spice things up a bit.		116.390448	39.927823	None							[]	[]		restaurant
china	beijing	Niúgē Jiǎozi	East of the Forbidden City, this cute dumpling joint dishes up dozens of varieties of jiǎozi, including beef (niúròu) , lamb (yángròu) , pork (zhūròu) , duck (yāròu) and donkey (lǘròu) , as well as a wide range of veggie ones such as mushroom and cabbage (xiānggū báicài). The limited English menu lists the basic range of dumplings, but there are many further mixed options, such as chicken and leek or celery, and pork or shrimp and eggplant, on the Chinese menu. A standard portion of jiǎozi is called a liǎng and the staff will do their best to help you out, or you can watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen and point out the ingredients you want.

Book ahead.The menu ranges across France, Italy, Greece and north Africa. We like the tagines and Sicilian seafood stew, but the signature dishes of leg of lamb and suckling pig are equally as tasty. If you can't snaffle a table on the terrace, the large, light-filled dining room is almost as good a spot to enjoy your meal. There’s a weekend brunch deal with two/three courses for ¥248/288.		116.392368	39.897267	4.0	180	122	70	13	8	4.0	[]	[]	False	restaurant
china	beijing	Yī Lóng Zhāi	Bright and boisterous, this no-frills restaurant specialises in the Turkic-influenced cuisine of Xīnjiāng province, in west China. So expect lots of tasty lamb dishes.

There's also a good selection of noodle dishes (¥12 to ¥18) in the photo menu.Another signature dish here is the dà pán jī (大盘鸡; literally, 'big plate chicken'; ¥70), which is enough to feed four or five hungry mouths, especially when the sauce is mopped up with some kǎo náng (烤馕; naan bread; ¥5). If there's only two or three of you, go for the small portion (xiǎo pán jī; 小盘鸡; ¥40), which is still massive.

For some it’s hideously overpriced and far from authentic. For others it’s the best roast duck restaurant in China.There are seven branches in Běijīng (and one in Shànghǎi): this one, by the Regent hotel, and another housed in part of the former Imperial Granaries are the most central. All are equally classy establishments. Note, it's not the roast duck that will neccessarily break the bank; it's the other dishes, delicious though they are. You'll pay ¥102, for example, for a medium portion of sauteed bean sprouts.

This one’s location near the Russian embassy guarantees it a loyal stream of customers drawn in by classic dishes such as borscht (Y18), Russian-style dumplings (Y20), chicken Kiev (Y38) and trout in sour cream (Y58).

It's on the 4th floor of a building opposite the Bǎinǎohuì Computer Mall . Little English is spoken, but there is a picture menu.Noodle options aside, the other dishes on the menu reveal the influence of the Muslim cuisine of Níngxià and Xīnjiāng. They're more expensive than the noodle choices, but the charcoal roasted lamb leg (¥48) is definitely worth trying. This is also one of the few places in the capital where you'll find yak meat.		116.439747	39.921553	5.0						5.0	[]	[]	False	restaurant

Upstairs, you can sip a martini (Y70) and try the Italian antipasti menu, or proper bar snacks such as oysters. Downstairs is the restaurant (dinner only, closed Sundays), which riffs on a French theme with dishes such as pigeon roasted in tobacco leaves (Y168).
