Museum of Modern Art	usa	new-york-city	activity	Superstar of the modern-art scene, MoMA's galleries scintillate with heavyweights: Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rothko, Pollock and Bourgeois. Since its founding in 1929, the museum has amassed almost 200,000 artworks, documenting the emerging creative ideas and movements of the late 19th century through to those that dominate today. For art buffs, it's Valhalla. For the uninitiated, it's a thrilling crash course in all that is beautiful and addictive about art.	MoMA's permanent collection spans four levels, with prints, illustrated books and the unmissable Contemporary Galleries on level two; architecture, design, drawings and photography on level three; and painting and sculpture on levels four and five. Many of the big hitters are on these last two levels, so tackle the museum from the top down before fatigue sets in. Must-sees include Van Gogh's The Starry Night, Cézanne's The Bather, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, and Henri Rousseau's The Sleeping Gypsy, not to mention iconic American works like Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans and Gold Marilyn Monroe, Lichtenstein's equally poptastic Girl with Ball, and Hopper's haunting House by the Railroad.When gallery fatigue sets in, recharge in MoMA's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, dotted with works by dexterous greats like Matisse, Miró and Picasso.	10:30am-5:30pm Sat-Thu, to 8pm Fri, to 8pm Thu Jul-Aug	['130:30 - 140:00', '10:30 - 17:30', '34:30 - 41:30', '58:30 - 65:30', '82:30 - 89:30', '106:30 - 113:30', '154:30 - 161:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-451686010_master.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.moma.org	True	True	150	adult/child $25/free, 4-8pm Fri free	['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-73.977226	40.761195	6.5	4.5	['3736', '1394', '477', '167', '102']	11 W 53rd St	11 West 53rd Street, , New York City, 10019	False	29	150	[]
National September 11 Memorial	usa	new-york-city	activity	The focal point of the National September 11 Memorial is Reflecting Absence, two imposing reflecting pools that occupy the very footprints of the ill-fated twin towers. From their rim, a steady cascade of water pours 30ft down towards a central void. Bronze panels frame the pools, inscribed with the names of those who died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and in the World Trade Center car bombing on February 26, 1993.		7:30am-9pm	['9:00 - 20:00', '33:00 - 44:00', '57:00 - 68:00', '81:00 - 92:00', '105:00 - 116:00', '129:00 - 140:00', '153:00 - 164:00']		http://www.911memorial.org	True	True	90		['Monument']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	-74.013251	40.71176	6.5	4.5	['31369', '5114', '1100', '259', '162']	180 Greenwich St	180 Greenwich St, , New York City, 10007-0089	False	2	90	[]
Lincoln Center	usa	new-york-city	activity	This stark arrangement of gleaming Modernist temples contains some of Manhattan’s most important performance spaces: Avery Fisher Hall (home to the New York Philharmonic), David H Koch Theater (site of the New York City ballet), and the iconic Metropolitan Opera House, whose interior walls are dressed with brightly saturated murals by painter Marc Chagall. Various other venues are tucked in and around the 16-acre campus, including a theater, two film-screening centers and the renowned Juilliard School.	Built in the 1960s, this imposing campus replaced a group of tenements called San Juan Hill, a predominantly African American neighborhood where the exterior shots for the movie West Side Story were filmed. In addition to being a controversial urban planning move, Lincoln Center wasn’t exactly well-received on an architectural level – it was relentlessly criticized for its conservative design, fortress-like aspect and poor acoustics. For the center’s 50th anniversary (2009–10), Diller Scofidio + Renfro and other architects gave the complex a much-needed and critically-acclaimed freshening up.A survey of the three classic buildings surrounding Revson Fountain is a must. These include the Metropolitan Opera, Avery Fisher Hall and the David H Koch Theater, the latter designed by Philip Johnson. (These are all located on the main plaza at Columbus Ave, between 62nd and 65th Sts.) The fountain is spectacular in the evenings when it puts on Las Vegas–like light shows.Of the refurbished structures, there are a number that are worth examining, including Alice Tully Hall, now displaying a very contemporary translucent, angled facade, and the David Rubenstein Atrium.On any given night, there are at least 10 performances happening throughout Lincoln Center – and even more in summer, when Lincoln Center Out of Doors (a series of dance and music concerts) and Midsummer Night Swing (ballroom dancing under the stars) lure those who love parks and culture. For details on seasons, tickets and programming – which runs the gamut from opera to dance to theater to ballet – check the website.Daily tours of the complex explore the Metropolitan Opera House, Revson Fountain and Alice Tully Hall and are a great way to get acquainted with the complex.

Washington Square Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	What was once a potter’s field and a square for public executions is now the unofficial town square of the Village, and plays host to lounging NYU students, tuba-playing street performers, curious canines and their owners, speed-chess pros, and bare-footed children who splash about in the fountain on warm days.	Encased in perfectly manicured brownstones and gorgeous twists of modern architecture (all owned by NYU) Washington Square Park is an enticing green space – especially as you are welcomed by the iconic Stanford White Arch on the north side of the green. The arch, colloquially known as the Washington Square Arch, dominates the park with its 72ft of beaming white Dover marble. Originally designed in wood to celebrate the centennial of George Washington’s inauguration in 1889, the arch proved so popular that it was replaced with stone six years later and adorned with statues of the general in war and peace. In 1916 artist Marcel Duchamp famously climbed to the top of the arch by its internal stairway and declared the park the ‘Free and Independent Republic of Washington Square.’Washington Square Park has long provided a stage for political activity and was the scene of a 2007 rally staged by Barack Obama to drum up support for his (successful) presidential nomination. When urban planners sought to change the shape and usages of the park, locals vehemently protested, and the square’s shape has remained largely unchanged since the 1800s.

High Line	usa	new-york-city	activity	It’s hard to believe that the High Line – a shining example of brilliant urban renewal – was once a dingy rail line that anchored a rather unsavory district of slaughterhouses. Today, this eye-catching attraction is one of New York's best-loved green spaces, drawing visitors far and wide who come to stroll, sit and picnic 30ft above the city, while enjoying fabulous views of Manhattan's ever-changing urban landscape.	The perks are numerous, and include stunning vistas of the Hudson River, public art installations, fat lounge chairs for soaking up some sun, willowy stretches of native-inspired landscaping (including a mini sumac forest), food and drink vendors, and a thoroughly unique perspective on the neighborhood streets below – especially at various overlooks, where bleacher-like seating faces huge panes of glass that frame the traffic, buildings and pedestrians below as living works of art. There’s also Andre Balazs’ luxury hotel, the Standard, which straddles the park, as well as the sparkling new Whitney Museum, which anchors the southern end.The High Line is an especially romantic place to stroll on a balmy night, when you can see the lit-up city (and maybe even a star or two) sparkling all around.	7am-11pm Jun-Sep, to 10pm Apr, May, Oct & Nov, to 7pm Dec-Mar	['7:00 - 23:00', '31:00 - 47:00', '55:00 - 71:00', '79:00 - 95:00', '103:00 - 119:00', '127:00 - 143:00', '151:00 - 167:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-568733199_super.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.thehighline.org	True	False	150		['Park']	['Scenic Walking Areas', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.008153	40.739511	6.5	4.5	['17539', '6427', '1573', '241', '79']	Gansevoort St		True	7	150	[]
Chelsea Market	usa	new-york-city	activity	In a shining example of redevelopment and preservation, the Chelsea Market has transformed a former factory into a shopping concourse that caters to foodies.

You can also linger over a more indulgent meal at the Green Table (serving farm-fresh organic ingredients), Cull  Pistol (first-rate seafood and a raw bar) or Friedman's Lunch (upscale American comfort food). Buy nonfood items at Imports from Marrakesh (specializing in Moroccan art and design), check out the latest literary hits at Posman Books, browse for a new outfit (or home accessory) at Anthropologie or pick up a bottle at the expert-staffed Chelsea Wine Vault.And that’s only the lower part of a larger, million-sq-ft space that occupies a full city block, current home of TV channels the Food Network, Oxygen Network, Google offices and NY1, the local news channel.

Hudson River Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	The High Line may be all the rage these days, but one block away from that famous elevated green space, there stretches a five-mile-long ribbon of green that has dramatically transformed the city over the past decade. Covering 550 acres, and running from Battery Park at Manhattan's southern tip to 59th St in Midtown, the Hudson River Park is Manhattan's wondrous backyard. The long riverside path is a great spot for cycling, running and strolling.	Several boathouses (including one in Chelsea near W 26th, and another in the West Village near Houston) offer kayak hire and longer excursions for the more experienced. There's also beach volleyball, basketball courts, a skate park and tennis courts. Families with kids have loads of option including four sparkling playgrounds, a carousel (off W 22nd St), mini golf, and grassy piers for young legs to run free.Those who simply need a break from the city, come here to loll on the grass for a bout of people-watching and river contemplation, while those seeking something less sedate can join the sangria- and sun-loving crowds at the dockside Frying Pan. The park is also a fine spot to come and watch the sunset. In the summer, the grassy lawns and converted piers host a wide range of free events from open-air film screenings and blues jams to dance parties and 'rumbles on the river' (featuring muay Thai kickboxing).

American Museum of Natural History	usa	new-york-city	activity	Founded in 1869 this classic museum contains a veritable wonderland of more than 30 million artifacts, including lots of menacing dinosaur skeletons, as well as the Rose Center for Earth  Space, with its cutting-edge planetarium. From September through May, the museum is home to the Butterfly Conservatory, a glass-house featuring 500-plus butterflies from all over the world.	On the natural history side, the museum is perhaps best known for its Fossil Halls containing nearly 600 specimens, including the skeletons of a massive mammoth and a fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex.There are also plentiful animal exhibits (the stuffed Alaskan brown bears are popular), galleries devoted to gems and an IMAX theater. The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life contains dioramas devoted to ecologies, weather and conservation, as well as a beloved 94ft replica of a blue whale. At the 77th St Lobby Gallery, visitors are greeted by a 63ft canoe carved by the Haida people of British Columbia in the middle of the 19th century.For the space set, it’s the Rose Center that is the star of the show. Its mesmerizing glass-box facade – home to space-show theaters and the planetarium – is indeed an otherworldly setting. Every half-hour between 10:30am and 4:30pm you can drop yourself into a cushy seat to view Dark Universe, narrated by famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, which explores the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos.Celebrities provide narration for some of the other films: Meryl Streep gives us the evolutionary lowdown on vertebrates on the fourth floor, while Liam Neeson narrates the four-minute Big Bang, which provides a fine introduction to exploring the rest of the Rose Center.	10am-5:45pm, Rose Center to 8:45pm Fri	['10:00 - 17:45', '34:00 - 41:45', '58:00 - 65:45', '82:00 - 89:45', '106:00 - 113:45', '130:00 - 137:45', '154:00 - 161:45']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/e916a9db6a2522a00ff1631adb051ce4-american-museum-of-natural-history.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.amnh.org	True	True	210	suggested donation adult/child $22/12.50	['Museum']	['Natural History Museums', 'Museums']	-73.9740213241	40.7809563762	6.5	4.5	['4105', '1930', '969', '357', '151']	Central Park West	79th Street and Central Park West, , New York City, 10024	False	32	210	[]

One, it resides in a lovely, rambling beaux arts structure built from 1913–14 by Carrère and Hastings. Two, it’s generally not crowded (one exception being during popular shows). And, three, it feels refreshingly intimate, with a trickling indoor courtyard fountain and gardens that can be explored on warmer days.

Ellis Island	usa	new-york-city	activity	Ellis Island is America's most famous and historically important gateway. Between 1892 and 1924, over 12 million immigrants passed through this processing station, their dreams in tow. Today, its three-level Immigration Museum delivers a poignant tribute to the immigrant experience. Featuring narratives from a number of sources, including historians and the immigrants themselves, the tour brings to life the museum’s hefty collection of personal objects, official documents, photographs and film footage. Always purchase your tickets online (www.statuecruises.com) to avoid the soul-crushingly long queues.	When you arrive, stop in the museum lobby to pick up your free audio guide, which offers rich insight into the exhibitions. If you're very short on time, skip the 'Journeys: The Peopling of America 1550–1890' exhibit on the 1st floor and focus on the 2nd floor. Here you'll find the two most fascinating exhibitions. The first, 'Through America's Gate,' examines the step-by-step process faced by the newly arrived, including the chalk-marking of those suspected of illness, a wince-inducing eye examination, and 29 questions in the beautiful, vaulted Registry Room. The second, 'Peak Immigration Years,' explores the motives behind the immigrants' journeys and the challenges they faced once free to begin their new American lives.For a history of the rise, fall and resurrection of the building itself, make time for the 'Restoring a Landmark' exhibition on the 3rd floor; its tableaux of trashed desks, chairs and other abandoned possessions are strangely haunting. The audio tour offers optional, in-depth coverage for those wanting to delve deeper into the collections and the island's history. If you don't feel like opting for the audio tour, you can always pick up one of the phones in each display area and listen to the recorded, yet affecting memories of real Ellis Island immigrants, taped in the 1980s.Another option is the free, 45-minute guided tour with a park ranger.

The museum's core exhibition includes a detailed exploration of the Holocaust, with personal artifacts, photographs and documentary films providing a personal, moving experience. Outdoors is the Garden of Stones installation. Created by artist Andy Goldsworthy and dedicated to those who lost loved ones in the Holocaust, its 18 boulders form a narrow pathway for contemplating the fragility of life.	The building itself consists of six sides and three tiers to symbolize the Star of David and the six million Jews who perished in WWII. Exhibitions aside, the venue also hosts films, music concerts, ongoing lecture series and special holiday performances. Frequent, free workshops for families with children are also on offer, while the on-site, kosher café serves light food.	10am-5:45pm Sun-Tue & Thu, to 8pm Wed, to 5pm Fri mid-Mar–mid-Nov, to 3pm Fri rest of yr	['10:00 - 17:45', '34:00 - 41:45', '58:00 - 65:45', '82:00 - 92:00', '106:00 - 113:45', '130:00 - 137:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-171568683_full.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.mjhnyc.org	True	False	120	adult/child $12/free, 4-8pm Wed free	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-74.0181478001	40.7057438486	6.5	4.5	['129', '48', '15', '1', '1']	36 Battery Pl	36 Battery Place, , New York City, 10280	True	112		[]
Brooklyn Bridge	usa	new-york-city	activity	A New York icon, the Brooklyn Bridge was the world’s first steel suspension bridge. Indeed, when it opened in 1883, the 1596ft span between its two support towers was the longest in history. Although its construction was fraught with disaster, the bridge became a magnificent example of urban design, inspiring poets, writers and painters. Today, its pedestrian walkway – which begins just east of City Hall – delivers a soul-stirring view of lower Manhattan; you should reach Brooklyn after about a 20-minute walk.	Ironically, one man deprived of this view was the bridge's very designer, John Roebling. The Prussian-born engineer was knocked off a pier in Fulton Landing in June 1869, dying of tetanus poisoning before construction of the Brooklyn Bridge even began. Consequently, his son, Washington Roebling, supervised its construction, which lasted 14 years and managed to survive budget overruns and the deaths of 20 workers. The younger Roebling himself suffered from the bends while helping to excavate the riverbed for the bridge’s western tower and remained bedridden for much of the project; his wife Emily oversaw construction in his stead. There was one final tragedy to come in June 1883, when the bridge opened to pedestrian traffic. Someone in the crowd shouted, perhaps as a joke, that the bridge was collapsing into the river, setting off a mad rush in which 12 people were trampled to death.Connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn, the bridge entered its second century as strong and beautiful as ever following an extensive renovation in the early 1980s. When walking across it, take care to stay on the side of the walkway marked for folks on foot, and not in the bike lane.

Metropolitan Museum of Art	usa	new-york-city	activity	This sprawling encyclopedic museum, founded in 1870, houses one of the biggest art collections in the world. Its permanent collection has more than two million individual objects, from Egyptian temples to American paintings. Known colloquially as ‘The Met,’ the museum attracts over six million visitors a year to its 17 acres of galleries – making it the largest single-site attraction in New York City. In other words, plan on spending some time here. It is B-I-G.	The museum has an unrivaled collection of ancient Egyptian art, some of which dates back to the Paleolithic era. Located to the north of the Great Hall, the 39 Egyptian galleries open dramatically with one of the Met’s prized pieces: the Mastaba Tomb of Perneb (c 2300 BC), an Old Kingdom burial chamber crafted from limestone.On the museum’s 2nd floor, the European Paintings’ galleries display a stunning collection of masterworks. The ‘New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia’ are comprised of 15 incredible rooms that showcase the museum’s extensive collection of art from the Middle East and Central and South Asia.In the northwest corner, the American galleries showcase a wide variety of decorative and fine art from throughout US history. The 27 galleries devoted to classical antiquity are another Met doozy, some of which are dramatically illuminated by natural daylight.The most popular galleries with children are generally the Egyptian, African and Oceania galleries (great masks) and the collection of medieval arms and armor – all of which are on the 1st floor. The Met hosts plenty of kid-centric happenings (check the website) and distributes a special museum brochure and map made specifically for the tykes.One of the best spots in the entire museum is the roof garden, which features rotating sculpture installations by contemporary and 20th century artists. (Jeff Koons, Andy Goldsworthy and Imran Qureshi have all shown here.) But its best feature are the views it offers of the city and Central Park. It’s also home to the Roof Garden Café  Martini Bar, the best place in the museum for a sip — especially at sunset. The roof garden is open from April to October.A desk inside the Great Hall has audio tours in several languages ($7), though you can access audio tours for free if you have a smartphone. Docents also offer guided tours of specific galleries (free with admission). Check the website or information desk for details. If you can’t stand crowds, avoid weekends.	10am-5.30pm Sun-Thu, to 9pm Fri & Sat	['10:00 - 17:30', '34:00 - 41:30', '58:00 - 65:30', '82:00 - 89:30', '106:00 - 113:30', '130:00 - 141:00', '154:00 - 165:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/86761495.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.metmuseum.org	True	True	150	suggested donation adult/child $25/free	['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.9632184289	40.7793936338	7.0	5.0	['18517', '3029', '528', '99', '52']	1000 Fifth Ave	1000 5th Ave, , New York City, 10028-0198	False	3	150	[]
Cathedral Church of St John the Divine	usa	new-york-city	activity	The largest place of worship in the US has yet to be completed – and probably won’t be any time soon. But this storied Episcopal cathedral nonetheless commands attention with its ornate Byzantine-style facade, booming vintage organ and extravagantly scaled nave – twice as wide as Westminster Abbey in London. Aside from a one-hour highlights tour, the cathedral also offers a one-hour vertical tour, taking you on a steep climb to the top of the Cathedral (bring your own flashlight).	Prayer services are held four times daily (three times on Saturday; see the website for the schedule). Two special services worth seeing are the annual Blessing of the Animals, a pilgrimage for pet owners held on the first Sunday of October, and the Blessing of the Bikes, held on May 1, when local riders tool in on everything from sleek 10-speeds to clunky cruisers.The cathedral itself was founded in the 19th century by Bishop Horatio Potter, with the first cornerstone laid on St John’s Day in 1892. The construction, however, was hardly a breeze. Engineers had to dig 70ft in order to find bedrock to which they could anchor the building. Architects died and were fired. And in 1911, the initial Romanesque design was exchanged for something bigger and more Gothic. Construction has been halted on countless occasions (whenever funds run out). To this day, the north tower remains unbuilt, and a ‘temporary’ domed roof, constructed out of terra-cotta tile in 1909, still shelters the Crossing. In 2001, there was a raging fire to contend with, too. Much of the church has since been restored, but the north transept, which was severely damaged, has not been rebuilt. If it is ever completed, the 601ft-long Cathedral will rank as the third-largest church in the world, after St Peter’s Basilica in Rome and Basilica of Our Lady of Peace at Yamoussoukro in Côte d’Ivoire. Just don’t count on this happening any time soon.Framing the western entrance are two rows of Gothic-inspired sculptures that were carved in the 1980s and '90s by British artist Simon Verity (b 1945). On the central pillar stands St John the Divine himself, author of the Book of Revelation. (Note the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse under his feet.) Flanking him are various biblical figures, including Moses, John the Baptist and Noah. Themes of devastation are rife, but most unnerving is the statue of Jeremiah (third on the right), which stands on a base that shows the New York City skyline – Twin Towers included – in the process of being destroyed.The nave is laid out west to east. Lining this monumental passageway are two magisterial sets of 17th century tapestries. The Barberini Tapestries from Italy depict scenes from the life of Christ, while the Mortlake Tapestries, based on cartoons by Raphael, show the Acts of the Apostles. Installed in 1932, the largest stained glass window in the country contains more than 10,000 individual pieces of glass. The design features a red-robed image of Christ at the center, from which trumpet-bearing angels radiate outward to the prophets.One of the most powerful organs in the world, the Great Organ was originally installed in 1911 and then enlarged and rebuilt in 1952. It contains 8035 pipes arranged in 141 ranks. The 2001 fire damaged the instrument, but a careful five-year restoration brought it back. You can hear it roar during services and concerts. Behind the choir is the silver triptych ‘Life of Christ,’ carved by '80s pop artist Keith Haring (1958–90). It's one of the last works of art he produced prior to succumbing to an AIDS-related illness at the age of 31.The Cathedral is situated on a lovely 11-acre plot. On the south side of the building, you’ll find the whimsical Children’s Sculpture Garden (check out the bizarre Peace Fountain, which shows the archangel Michael and Satan doing battle) and the Biblical Garden, containing plants mentioned in the Bible.	7:30am-6pm, highlights tour 11am & 2pm Mon, 11am & 1pm Tue-Sat, 1pm on selected Sun, vertical tour noon Wed & Fri, noon & 2pm Sat	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/shutterstock_180468908.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.stjohndivine.org	True	False	30	suggested donation $10, highlights tour $12, vertical tour $20	['Church']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.962364	40.804008	6.5	4.5	['461', '142', '23', '7', '2']	1047 Amsterdam Ave	1047 Amsterdam Ave, , New York City, 10025-1747	True	48	30	[]
Statue of Liberty	usa	new-york-city	activity	Reserve your tickets online well in advance (up to six months ahead) to access Lady Liberty’s crown, from where the city and harbor are breathtaking. If you miss out on crown tickets, you may have better luck with tickets to the pedestal, which also offers commanding views. If you don't score either, don't fret: all ferry tickets to Liberty Island offer basic access to the grounds, including guided ranger tours or self-guided audio tours. Book all tickets online (www.statuecruises.com) to avoid the long queues.	Conceived as early as 1865 by French intellectual Edouard Laboulaye as a monument to the republican principals shared by France and the USA, the Statue of Liberty is still generally recognized as a symbol for at least the ideals of opportunity and freedom to many. French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi traveled to New York in 1871 to select the site, then spent more than 10 years in Paris designing and making the 151ft-tall figure Liberty Enlightening the World. It was then shipped to New York, erected on a small island in the harbor and unveiled in 1886. Structurally, it consists of an iron skeleton (designed by Gustave Eiffel) with a copper skin attached to it by stiff but flexible metal bars.Liberty Island is usually visited in conjunction with nearby Ellis Island. Ferries leave from Battery Park, with South Ferry and Bowling Green the closest subway stations. Ferry tickets include admission to both sights.	8:30am-5:30pm, check website for seasonal changes	['8:30 - 16:00', '32:30 - 40:00', '56:30 - 64:00', '80:30 - 88:00', '104:30 - 112:00', '128:30 - 136:00', '152:30 - 160:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/21c6ef0ba96e0ce5107a91c4506e2df7-statue-of-liberty.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.nps.gov/stli	True	True	210	adult/child incl Ellis Island $18/9, incl crown $21/12	['Monument']	['Monuments & Statues', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.044558	40.689213	6.5	4.5	['9030', '3579', '1088', '251', '135']	Liberty Island		False	14	210	[]
Empire State Building	usa	new-york-city	activity	This limestone classic was built in just 410 days – using seven million hours of labor during the Great Depression – and the view from its 86th-floor outdoor deck and 102nd-floor indoor deck are heavenly. Alas, the queues to the top are notorious. Getting here very early or very late will help you avoid delays – as will buying your tickets online, ahead of time, where an extra $2 convenience fee is well worth the hassle it will save you.	As one would expect, the views from both decks are especially spectacular at sunset. For a little of that Arthur's Theme magic, head to the 86th floor between 9pm and 1am Thursday to Saturday, when the twinkling sea of lights is accompanied by a soundtrack of live sax (requests are welcome).Located on the site of the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the 1454ft-high (to the top of the antenna) behemoth opened in 1931 after the laying of 10 million bricks, installation of 6400 windows and setting of 328,000 sq ft of marble. The famous antenna was originally meant to be a mooring mast for zeppelins, but the Hindenberg disaster slammed the brakes on that plan. Later an aircraft did (accidentally) meet up with the building: a B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor on a foggy day in 1945, killing 14 people.Since 1976, the building’s top 30 floors have been floodlit in a spectrum of colors each night, reflecting seasonal and holiday hues. Famous combos include orange, white and green for St Patrick’s Day; blue and white for Chanukah; white, red and green for Christmas; and the rainbow colors for Gay Pride weekend in June. For a full rundown of the color schemes, check the website.	8am-2am, last elevators up 1:15am	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/stock-photo-new-york-city-manhattan-100424161.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.esbnyc.com	True	True	90	86th-fl observation deck adult/child $32/26, incl 102nd-fl observation deck $52/46	['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Observation Decks & Towers', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.985506	40.748338	6.5	4.5	['18890', '8274', '3061', '1097', '772']	350 Fifth Ave	350 Fifth Avenue, , New York City, 10118-0110	False	12	90	[]
New Museum of Contemporary Art	usa	new-york-city	activity	Rising above the neighborhood, the New Museum of Contemporary Art is a sight to behold: a seven-story stack of off-kilter, white, ethereal boxes designed by Tokyo-based architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA and the New York–based firm Gensler. It was a long-awaited breath of fresh air along what was a completely gritty Bowery strip when it arrived back in 2007 – though since its opening, many glossy new constructions have joined it, quickly transforming this once down-and-out avenue.	Founded in 1977 by Marcia Tucker and housed in five different locations over the years, the museum's mission statement is simple: 'New art, new ideas.' The institution gave gallery space to artists Keith Haring, Jeff Koons, Joan Jonas, Mary Kelly and Andres Serrano at the beginning of their careers, and continues to show contemporary heavy hitters. In fact, the city's sole museum dedicated to contemporary art has brought a steady menu of edgy works in new forms.	11am-6pm Wed & Fri-Sun, to 9pm Thu	['130:30 - 140:00', '10:30 - 17:30', '34:30 - 41:30', '58:30 - 65:30', '82:30 - 89:30', '106:30 - 113:30', '154:30 - 161:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/932bc4dc47b7835f50c9aca4f5cce77d86c99072d77e5de6f8ae480510aa96fd/0991b92df7f084df0bfb3a4a1c0b946e15698c5fba633d4a391ea3fd5140fba9.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.newmuseum.org	True	True	150	adult/child $16/free, 7-9pm Thu by donation	['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-73.9930802194	40.7223259136	6.5	4.5	['3736', '1394', '477', '167', '102']	235 Bowery	11 West 53rd Street, , New York City, 10019	False	29	150	[]
Guggenheim Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	A sculpture in its own right, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s building almost overshadows the collection of 20th century art it houses. The museum’s holdings include works by Kandinsky, Picasso and Jackson Pollock. Over time, other key additions have been made, including paintings by Monet, Van Gogh and Degas, photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, and key surrealist works. Temporary exhibitions are the real draw – the best of which are stunning site-specific installations by some of the great visionary artists of today.	Completed in 1959, the inverted ziggurat structure was derided by some critics but hailed by others who welcomed it as a beloved architectural icon. Since it first opened, this unusual structure has appeared on countless postcards, TV programs and films. The Guggenheim came out of the collection of Solomon R Guggenheim, a New York mining magnate who began acquiring abstract art in his 60s at the behest of his art adviser, an eccentric German baroness named Hilla Rebay.The museum’s ascending ramp is occupied by rotating exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. Though Wright intended visitors to go to the top and wind their way down, the cramped, single elevator doesn’t allow for this. Exhibitions, therefore, are installed from bottom to top.There are two good on-site food options: The Wright, at ground level, a space-age eatery serving steamy risotto and classic cocktails, and Cafe 3, on the 3rd floor, which offers sparkling views of Central Park and excellent coffee and light snacks.	10am-5:45pm Sun-Wed & Fri, to 7:45pm Sat, closed Thu	['10:00 - 17:45', '34:00 - 41:45', '58:00 - 65:45', '82:00 - 89:45', '130:00 - 137:45', '154:00 - 163:45']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-518315269_full.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.guggenheim.org	True	False	120	adult/child $25/free, by donation 5:45-7:45pm Sat	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-73.9588236497	40.783095828	4.5	3.5	['692', '522', '425', '294', '221']	1071 Fifth Ave	1071 Fifth Ave. at 89th St., , New York City, 10128	False	111		[]
Flatiron Building	usa	new-york-city	activity	Designed by Daniel Burnham and built in 1920, the 20-story Flatiron Building has a uniquely narrow triangular footprint that resembles the prow of a massive ship. It also features a traditional beaux arts limestone and terra-cotta facade, built over a steel frame, that gets more complex and beautiful the longer you stare at it. Best viewed from the traffic island north of 23rd St between Broadway and Fifth Ave, this unique structure dominated the plaza back in the dawning skyscraper era of the early 1900s.	The construction of the Flatiron Building (originally known as the Fuller Building) coincided with the proliferation of mass-produced picture postcards – the partnership was kismet. Even before its completion, there were images of the soon-to-be tallest tower circulating the globe, creating much wonder and excitement.Publisher Frank Munsey was one of the building’s first tenants. From his 18th-floor offices he published Munsey’s Magazine, which featured the writings of short-story writer William Sydney Porter, whose pen name was ‘O Henry.’ His musings (in popular stories such as ‘The Gift of the Magi’), the paintings of John Sloan and photographs of Alfred Stieglitz best immortalized the Flatiron back in the day – along with a famous comment by actress Katharine Hepburn, who quipped that she’d like to be admired as much as the grand old building.

Chrysler Building	usa	new-york-city	activity	Designed by Willian Van Alen in 1930, the 77-floor Chrysler Building is prime-time architecture: a fusion of Moderne and Gothic aesthetics, adorned with steel eagles and topped by a spire that screams Bride of Frankenstein. The building was constructed as the headquarters for Walter P Chrysler and his automobile empire. Unable to compete on the production line with bigger rivals Ford and General Motors, Chrysler trumped them on the skyline and with one of Gotham's most beautiful lobbies.	Indeed, while the Chrysler Building mightn't offer a restaurant or observation deck, its lobby makes for a lavish consolation prize. Here, dark, exotic African wood and marble contrast against the brash, man-made steel of industrial America. The lobby's elaborately veneered elevators are especially beautiful, their Egyptian lotus motifs made of inlaid Japanese ash, Oriental walnut and Cuban plum-pudding wood. Above is painter Edward Trumbull's ceiling mural Transport and Human Endeavor. Purportedly the world’s largest mural at 97ft by 100ft, its depiction of buildings, airplanes and industrious workers on Chrysler assembly lines shows the golden promise of industry and modernity.More than 80 years on, Chrysler's ambitious $15 million statement remains one of New York's most poignant symbols. For a great view of the Chrysler Building, head to the corner of Third Ave and 44th St, from where you can appreciate the building's slimline profile, gargoyles and spire in one hit. If you have binoculars, bring them for a close-up view of the facade's detailing, which includes basket-weave motifs and a band of abstract automobiles. Alternatively, head to the top of the Chrysler Building's taller rival, the Empire State Building, where pay-per-view telescopes will get you up close and personal with that gleaming steel spire.	lobby 8am-6pm Mon-Fri	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/bb732ec0787e7614de9c247eaad3d4a5-chrysler-building.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	90		['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.975464	40.751443	6.5	4.5	['555', '280', '77', '11', '4']	405 Lexington Ave	405 Lexington and 42nd St., , New York City, 10174	True	46		[]
Rockefeller Center	usa	new-york-city	activity	This 22-acre 'city within a city' debuted at the height of the Great Depression. Taking nine years to build, it was America's first multiuse retail, entertainment and office space – a sprawl of 19 buildings (14 of which are the original moderne structures). Developer John D Rockefeller Jr may have sweated over the $100 million price tag, but it was worth it, the center declared a National Landmark in 1987. Highlights include the Top of the Rock observation deck and NBC Studio Tours.	The Rockefeller Center is also graced with the creations of 30 great artists, commissioned around the punchy theme ‘Man at the Crossroads Looks Uncertainly But Hopefully at the Future.’ Paul Manship contributed Prometheus, overlooking the sunken plaza, and Atlas, in front of the International Building (630 Fifth Ave). Isamu Noguchi's News sits above the entrance to the Associated Press Building (50 Rockefeller Plaza), while José Maria Sert's oil American Progress awaits in the lobby of the GE Building. The latter work replaced Mexican artist Diego Rivera's original painting, rejected by the Rockefellers for containing ‘communist imagery.’Come the festive season, Rockefeller Plaza is where you'll find New York's most famous Christmas tree. Ceremoniously lit just after Thanksgiving, it's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s, when construction workers set up a small tree on the site. In its shadow, Rink at Rockefeller Center is the city's most famous ice-skating rink. Incomparably magical, it's also undeniably small and crowded. Opt for the first skating period (8.30am) to avoid a long wait. Come summer, the rink becomes a cafe.

Studio Museum in Harlem	usa	new-york-city	activity	This small, cultural gem has been exhibiting the works of African American artists for more than four decades. While its rotating exhibition program is always fascinating, the museum is not just another art display center. It is an important point of connection for Harlem cultural figures of all stripes, who arrive to check out a rotating selection of shows, attend film screenings or sign up for gallery talks.	Founded in 1968, the museum originally came to life in a small loft space off 125th St that was sandwiched between a couple of garment factories and a supermarket. But it quickly became known for its thoughtful, contemporary-minded exhibits and vibrant event programming, which included concerts, poetry readings and lectures. Roughly a dozen years after its establishment, it moved to its present location, a renovated bank building that offered more room for exhibits, archives and the growing permanent collection. You’ll also find the Harlem Visitor Information Kiosk located here.The permanent collection is small (just under 2000 objects), but it is rich. The Studio Museum has been an important patron to African American artists and the collection features work by more than 400 of them. This includes important pieces by painter Jacob Lawrence, photographer Gordon Parks and collagist Romare Bearden – all of whom are represented in major museum collections in the US.In addition, its photography holdings include an extensive archive of work by James VanDerZee (1886–1983), an unparalleled chronicler of early 20th century Harlem life. He shot portraits of prominent entertainers and black nationalists, and continued to take pictures well into his nineties. One well-known snap shows Jean-Michel Basquiat, the ’80s graffiti artist and painter, sitting pensively with a Siamese cat on his lap.The museum’s long-running artist-in-residence program has provided crucial support to a long list of well-known artists, including conceptualist David Hammons, figurative painter Mickalene Thomas and portraitist Kehinde Wiley, and the venue hosts regular special events, including artist talks and workshops (check the website).When visiting, make sure to look up on your way in. One of the museum’s most iconic works hangs right outside the front door: Hammons’ 1990 piece ‘African-American Flag’ replaces the traditional red, white and blue of the Stars and Stripes with the red, green and black of the pan-African flag. It is a sly comment on the African American presence in the US.	noon-9pm Thu & Fri, 10am-6pm Sat, noon-6pm Sun	['24:00 - 42:00', '120:00 - 141:00', '144:00 - 165:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/94d0d20ee29a80c38fb63618b9bb63f8-studio-museum-in-harlem.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.studiomuseum.org	True	False	120	suggested donation $7, Sun free	['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-73.947655	40.808499	5.0	4.0	['16', '19', '1', '2', '0']	144 W 125th St	144 W 125th St, , New York City, 10027-4423	False	326		[]
Merchant's House Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	Built in 1832 and purchased by merchant Seabury Tredwell three years later, this red-brick mansion remains the most authentic Federal house in town. It's as much about the city’s mercantile past as it is a showcase of 19th-century high-end domestic furnishings. Everything in the house is a testament to what money could buy, from the bronze gasoliers and marble mantelpieces, to the elegant parlor chairs, attributed to noted furniture designer Duncan Phyfe. Even the multilevel call bells for the servants works to this day.	Many believe that the ghost of Gertrude Tredwell – Seabury's youngest child and the building's last resident – haunts the old mansion, making cameo appearances late in evenings and sometimes at public events. At a Valentine’s Day concert a few years back several attendees witnessed the shadow of a woman walk up to the performers and take a seat in the parlor chairs. Appropriately, the museum offers ghost tours after dark (usually in late October), as well as lectures, special events and historical walking tours of NoHo.

Lower East Side Tenement Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	This museum puts the neighborhood’s heartbreaking but inspiring heritage on full display in three re-creations of turn-of-the-20th-century tenements. Re-creations include the late-19th-century home and garment shop of the Levine family from Poland, and two immigrant dwellings from the Great Depressions of 1873 and 1929. Visits to the tenements and other sites of interest are available only as part of scheduled tours (the price of which is included in the admission), with many daily departures.	In addition to the 'Hard Times' tour that visits the three tenements, the museum also runs various other tours: 'Sweatshop Workers' illuminates life among garment workers and the balance between the job, family life and religion. 'Irish Outsiders' visits the restored home of Irish immigrants who dealt with the death of a child in the 1800s. You can have a more interactive experience by meeting 'Victoria Confino', which gives a first-hand glimpse of life in a tenement as related by a 14-year-old Italian immigrant (played by a costumed interpreter, of course). It's the only tour appropriate for children (age five and up). There are also neighborhood walking tours, food-focused tours, and special evening tours on Thursday nights.The visitor center shows a video detailing the difficult life endured by the people who once lived in the surrounding buildings, which more often than not had no running water or electricity. Reserve tickets ahead online; popular tours sell out in advance.	tours 10:15am-5pm Fri-Wed, to 6:30pm Thu	['106:00 - 116:30', '10:00 - 18:30', '34:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 66:30', '82:00 - 90:30', '130:00 - 138:30', '154:00 - 162:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/23109b35ad75496b719ff7a77f66b752-lower-east-side-tenement-museum.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.tenement.org	True	False	90	adult/student from $25/20	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-73.989959	40.718737	6.5	4.5	['3222', '862', '207', '83', '39']	103 Orchard St	103 Orchard St, , New York City, 10002-3102	True	26	90	[]
Grand Central Terminal	usa	new-york-city	activity	Completed in 1913, Grand Central Terminal – more commonly, if technically incorrectly, called Grand Central Station – is another of New York’s beaux-arts beauties. Adorned with Tennessee marble floors and Italian marble ticket counters, its glorious main concourse is capped by a vaulted ceiling depicting the constellations. That these are presented backwards is no mistake: French painter Paul César Helleu wished to depict the stars from God's point of view, from the out, looking in.  	The original, frescoed execution of Helleu's design was by New York–based artists J Monroe Hewlett and Charles Basing. Moisture damage saw it faithfully repainted (alas, not in fresco form) by Charles Gulbrandsen in 1944. By the 1990s, however, the mural was in ruins again. Enter renovation architects Beyer Blinder Belle, who restored the work, but left a tiny patch of soot (in the northwest corner) as testament to just what a fine job they did.    Clad in Connecticut Stony Creek granite at its base and Indiana limestone on top, Grand Central's showpiece facade is crowned by America's greatest monumental sculpture, The Glory of Commerce. Designed by the French sculptor Jules Félix Coutan, the piece was executed in Long Island City by local carvers Donnely and Ricci. Once completed, it was hoisted up, piece by piece, in 1914. Its protagonist is a wing-capped Mercury, the Roman god of travel and commerce. To the left is Hercules in an unusually placid stance, while looking down on the mayhem of 42nd St is Minerva, the ancient guardian of cities. The clock beneath Mercury's foot contains the largest example of Tiffany glass in the world.    These days, Grand Central’s underground electric tracks serve only commuter trains en route to northern suburbs and Connecticut. But whether you’re traveling somewhere or not, the station merits a special trip for the architecture alone – not to mention for its swank cocktail lounge Campbell's Apartment, vaulted Grand Central Oyster Bar  Restaurant, and grab-and-go Grand Central Market.  	5:30am-2am	['5:30 - 26:00', '29:30 - 50:00', '53:30 - 74:00', '77:30 - 98:00', '101:30 - 122:00', '125:30 - 146:00', '149:30 - 168:00', '0:00 - 2:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/291365624e2be80c126423f6b03dd123-grand-central-terminal.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.grandcentralterminal.com	True	True	90		['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.97717442	40.75298929	6.5	4.5	['10167', '4357', '685', '56', '22']	42nd St	89 E 42nd Street, , New York City, 10017-5503	False	9	90	[]
Apollo Theater	usa	new-york-city	activity	The Apollo is an intrinsic part of Harlem history and culture. A leading space for concerts and political rallies since 1914, its venerable stage hosted virtually every major black artist in the 1930s and ’40s, including Duke Ellington and Billie Holiday. Decades later, it would help launch the careers of countless stars, from Diana Ross and Aretha Franklin to Michael Jackson and Lauryn Hill. Today, its thriving program of music, dance, master classes and special events continues to draw crowds and applause.	The Apollo’s most famous event is the long-running Amateur Night, which takes place every Wednesday night. The wild and ruthless crowd is as fun to watch as the performers. Fascinating tours of the building require groups of 20 or more with advance reservation, though individuals are welcome to join group tours based on availability (see the website).

Union Square	usa	new-york-city	activity	Union Square is like the Noah’s Ark of New York, rescuing at least two of every kind from the curling seas of concrete. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find a more eclectic cross-section of locals gathered in one public place: suited businessfolk gulping fresh air during their lunch breaks, dreadlocked loiterers tapping beats on their tabla, skateboarders flipping tricks on the southeastern stairs, rowdy college kids guzzling student-priced eats, and throngs of protesting masses chanting fervently for various causes.	Opened in 1831, Union Square quickly became the central gathering place for those who lived in the mansions nearby. Concert halls and artist societies further enhanced the cultured atmosphere, and high-end shopping quickly proliferated along Broadway, which was dubbed ‘Ladies’ Mile.’ When the Civil War broke out, the vast public space (large by New York standards, of course) was center stage for protesters of all sorts, from union workers to political activists. By the height of the WWI, the area had fallen largely into disuse, allowing politically and socially driven organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the Communist and Socialist Parties and the Ladies’ Garment Workers Union to move in. After over a century of the continuous push-and-pull between dapper-dom and political protest, a third – artistic, if not thoroughly hippie-ish – ingredient was tossed into the mix when Andy Warhol moved his Factory to Union Sq West. The building is now a chain candy store – a telling sign of the times.A walk around Union Square will reveal almost a dozen notable pieces of art, including an imposing equestrian statue of George Washington (one of the first public pieces of art in New York City). On the southern side of the square sits Metronome, a massive art installation consisting of two parts – a digital clock with a puzzling display of numbers, and a wand-like apparatus with smoke puffing out of concentric rings. A symbolic representation of the passage of time, the clock’s 14 digital numbers must be split into two groups of seven – the seven from the left tell the current time (hour, minute, second, tenth-of-a-second) and the seven from the right are meant to be read in reverse order; they represent the remaining amount of time in the day.

Roosevelt Island	usa	new-york-city	activity	Floating in the East River between Manhattan’s eastern edge and Queens, New York’s anomalous, planned neighborhood sits on a tiny island no wider than a football field. At the southern tip of the Island is architect Louis Kahn’s striking memorial to Franklin D Roosevelt. Zipping across the river via the four-minute aerial tram is a trip in itself and worth it for the stunning view of the East Side of Manhattan framed by the 59th St Bridge.	It was once known as Blackwell’s Island after the farming family who lived here; the city bought the island in 1828 and constructed several public hospitals and a mental hospital. In the 1970s, New York State built housing for 10,000 people along Roosevelt Island’s Main St (the only street on the island). The planned area along the cobblestone roadway resembles an Olympic village or, as some observe more cynically, cookie-cutter college housing.With fine views and little traffic, this quiet island is conducive to lounging and cycling. Trams leave from the Roosevelt Island Tramway Station (payment is via MetroCard). Otherwise, take the F train to the Roosevelt Island stop.

Prospect Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	The creators of the 585-acre Prospect Park – Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux – considered this an improvement on their other New York project, Central Park. Created in 1866, Prospect Park has many of the same features. It’s gorgeous, with a long meadow running along the western half, filled with soccer, football, cricket and baseball players (and barbecuers), hilly forests and a lovely boathouse on the east side.	Many visitors come to bike, run, stroll or just lounge around. It has a zoo, an ice-skating rink (which becomes a water play area for kids in the warm months), and pedal boats for hire in the summer. There are are also free concerts at the Prospect Park Bandshell (near the 9th St and Prospect Park W entrance).	5am-1am	[]		http://www.prospectpark.org	True	False	90		['Park']	['Nature & Parks']	-73.97122937	40.6681768	6.5	4.5	['446', '186', '32', '3', '0']	Grand Army Plaza	450 Flatbush Ave, , Brooklyn, 11225-3707	True	7		[]
Radio City Music Hall	usa	new-york-city	activity	This spectacular Moderne movie palace was the brainchild of vaudeville producer Samuel Lionel 'Roxy' Rothafel. Never one for understatement, Roxy launched his venue on 23 December 1932 with an over-the-top extravaganza that included camp dance troupe the Roxyettes (mercifully renamed the Rockettes). Guided tours (75 minutes) of the sumptuous interiors include the glorious auditorium, Witold Gordon's classically inspired mural History of Cosmetics in the Women's Downstairs Lounge, and the très exclusive VIP Roxy Suite.	As far as catching a show here goes, be warned: the vibe doesn't quite match the theater's glamor these days. That said, there are often some fabulous talents in the lineup, with past performers including Rufus Wainwright, Aretha Franklin and Dolly Parton. And while the word 'Rockettes' provokes eye rolling from most self-consciously cynical New Yorkers, fans of glitz and kitsch might just get a thrill from the troupe's annual Christmas Spectacular.Same-day tickets are available at the candy store beside the Sixth Ave entrance, though it's worth considering paying the extra $5 to book your ticket online given that tours can sell out quickly, particularly on rainy days.	tours 10am-5pm	[]		http://www.radiocity.com	True	False	150	tours adult/child $26.95/19.95	['Historic Building']	['Theaters', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Concerts & Shows']	-73.9795455874	40.7599121681	6.5	4.5	['3406', '910', '162', '46', '46']	1260 Sixth Ave	1260 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas), , New York City, 10020	True	21	150	[]
Brooklyn Bridge Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	This 85-acre park is one of Brooklyn’s best loved new attractions. Wrapping around a bend on the East River, it runs for 1.3 miles from the eastern edge of the Manhattan Bridge in Dumbo to the west end of Atlantic Ave in Cobble Hill. It has revitalized a once-barren stretch of shoreline, turning a series of abandoned piers into beautifully landscaped parkland with jaw-dropping views of Manhattan. There's lots to see and do here, with playgrounds, walkways and lawns.	You'll find free open-air summertime events like film screenings, outdoor yoga classes and dance parties (all on Pier 1); courts for basketball, handball and boccie, plus a skating rink (Pier 2); kayak and stand-up paddleboard hire (Pier 4 beach); fantastic playgrounds and a watery play area (Pier 6); and even a new bouldering wall (under the Manhattan Bridge in Dumbo). Summertime ferries to Governors Island depart from Pier 6. Pier 5 has sand volleyball courts and good food options (ice cream, wood-fired pizzas). Empire Fulton Ferry, just past the Brooklyn Bridge, has the lovingly restored 1922 Jane's Carousel and the best views of the bridge framed against the towering skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan.	6am-1am	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/e43c0eea216589489c63b501ccb6f6c3-brooklyn-bridge-park.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org	True	True	90		['Park']	['Bridges', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.9966	40.70196	6.5	4.5	['4529', '1592', '269', '50', '12']	East River Waterfront	City Hall Park, , Brooklyn	False	1		[]
Coney Island	usa	new-york-city	activity	About 50 minutes by subway from Midtown, this popular beach neighborhood makes for a great day trip. The wide sandy beach of Coney Island has retained its nostalgic, kitschy and slightly sleazy charms, wood-plank boardwalk and famous 1927 Cyclone roller coaster amid a modern amusement-park area. The New York Aquarium is a big hit with kids, as is taking in an early evening baseball game at KeySpan Park, the waterfront stadium for the minor league Brooklyn Cyclones.	The area traces its amusement-park roots to the mid-1800s, when inhabitants of the increasingly industrialized city began to seek relief from their sweltering tenements in summer. By the late 19th century, the area was a rough-and-tumble party spot dubbed ‘Sodom by the Sea.’ In the early 1900s, however, family amusements began to materialize. The most famous, Luna Park, opened in 1903 – a dream world with live camels and elephants, illuminated by more than a million bulbs. Today, it is still possible to ride the Wonder Wheel (opened in 1920) and the clackety Cyclone roller coaster (1927). The area was a bit of a ghost town in the ’80s, but it has experienced a resurgence in recent years, drawing New Yorkers who come to chow on hot dogs, catch a sideshow, and dress up like punk mermaids at the annual Mermaid Parade. It ain’t Disney – but it isn’t meant to be.

Times Square	usa	new-york-city	activity	Love it or hate it, the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Ave (aka: Times Square) pumps out the NYC of the global imagination – yellow cabs, golden arches, soaring skyscrapers and razzle-dazzle Broadway marquees. It's right here that Al Jolson 'made it' in the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, that photojournalist Alfred Eisenstaedt famously captured a lip-locked sailor and nurse on V-J Day in 1945, and that Alicia Keys and Jay-Z waxed lyrically about this 'concrete jungle where dreams are made'.	For several decades, the dream here was a sordid, wet one. The economic crash of the early 1970s led to a mass exodus of corporations from Times Square. Billboard niches went dark, stores shut and once grand hotels were converted into SRO (single-room occupancy) dives, attracting the poor and the destitute. What was once an area bathed in light and showbiz glitz became a dirty den of drug dealers and crime. While the adjoining Theater District survived, its respectable playhouses shared the streets with porn cinemas, strip clubs and adult bookstores.That all changed with tough-talking mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, in the 1990s, forced out the skin flicks, boosted police numbers and lured a wave of 'respectable' retail chains, restaurants and attractions. By the new millennium, Times Square had gone from 'X-rated' to 'G-rated,' drawing around 50 million visitors annually.

St Marks Place	usa	new-york-city	activity	One of the most magical things about New York is that every street tells a story, from the action unfurling before your eyes to the dense history hidden behind colorful facades. St Marks Place is one of the best strips of pavement in the city for story telling, as almost every building on these hallowed blocks is rife with tales from a time when the East Village embodied a far more lawless spirit.	Technically St Marks Place is 8th St between Third Ave and Ave A; it earned its saintly moniker from the like-named church nearby on 10th St. Easily one of NYC’s most famous streets, St Marks Place is also one of the city’s smallest, occupying only three blocks between Astor Pl and Tompkins Square Park. The road, however, is jam-packed with historical tidbits that would delight any trivia buff. Some of the most important addresses include number 2, 4, 96 and 98, and 122 St Marks PlaceNumber 2 St Marks Place is known as the St Mark’s Ale House, but for a time it was the famous Five-Spot, where jazz fiend Thelonious Monk got his start in the 1950s. A cast of colorful characters have left their mark at 4 St Marks Place: Alexander Hamilton’s son built the structure, James Fenimore Cooper lived here in the 1830s and Yoko Ono’s Fluxus artists descended upon the building in the 1960s. The buildings at 96 and 98 St Marks Place are immortalized on the cover of Led Zepellin’s Physical Graffiti album. Though it closed in the 1990s, number 122 St Marks Place was the location of a popular cafe called Sin-é, where Jeff Buckley and David Gray often performed.

One World Trade Center	usa	new-york-city	activity	Home to One World Observatory – New York's highest observation deck – the 104-floor One World Trade Center is architect David M Childs' redesign of Daniel Libeskind's original 2002 concept. Not only the loftiest building in America, this tapered giant is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, not to mention the fourth tallest in the world by pinnacle height.	The tower soars skywards with chamfered edges. The result is a facade of isosceles triangles that, seen from the base, reach to infinity. Crowning the structure is a 408ft cabled-stayed spire. Co-designed by sculptor Kenneth Snelson, it brings the building's total height to 1776ft, a symbolic reference to the year of American independence. Indeed, symbolism feeds several aspects of the building: the tower's footprint is equal to those of the twin towers, while the observation decks match the heights of those in the former complex. Unlike the original towers, however, One WTC was built with a whole new level of safety in mind, its precautionary features including a 200ft-high blast-resistant base (clad in over 2000 pieces of glimmering prismatic glass) and 1m-thick concrete walls encasing all elevators, stairwells, and communication and safety systems. One thing that wasn't foreseen by the architects and engineers was the antenna's noisy disposition; the strong winds that race through its lattice design producing a haunting, howling sound known to keep some locals up at night.

Central Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	One of the world’s most renowned green spaces, Central Park spreads across 843 acres of rolling meadows, boulder-studded outcroppings,elm-lined walkways, manicured European-style gardens, a lake and a reservoir — not to mention an outdoor theater, a memorial to John Lennon, an idyllic waterside eatery (the Loeb Boathouse) and one very famous statue of Alice in Wonderland. Highlights include Sheep Meadow, where thousands of people lounge and play on warm days; Central Park Zoo; and the forest-like paths of the Ramble.	Like the city’s subway system, the vast and majestic Central Park, a rectangle of open space in the middle of Manhattan, is a great class leveler – which is exactly what it was envisioned to be. Created in the 1860s and ’70s by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the marshy northern fringe of the city, the immense park was designed as a leisure space for all New Yorkers, regardless of color, class or creed. And it’s an oasis from the insanity: the lush lawns, cool forests, flowering gardens, glassy bodies of water and meandering, wooded paths providing the dose of serene nature that New Yorkers crave.Olmsted and Vaux (who also created Prospect Park in Brooklyn) were determined to keep foot and road traffic separate and cleverly designed the cross-town transverses under elevated roads to do so. That such a large expanse of prime real estate has survived intact for so long again proves that nothing eclipses the heart, soul and pride that forms the foundation of New York City’s greatness.Today, this ‘people’s park’ is still one of the city’s most popular attractions, beckoning throngs of New Yorkers with free outdoor concerts on the Great Lawn, precious animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center and top-notch drama at the annual Shakespeare in the Park productions, held each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater. Other recommended stops include the ornate Bethesda Fountain, which edges the Lake and its Loeb Boathouse, where you can rent rowboats or enjoy lunch at an outdoor cafe; the Shakespeare Garden, on the west side between 79th and 80th Sts, with its lush plantings and excellent skyline views; and the Ramble, a wooded thicket that’s popular with bird-watchers. While parts of the park swarm with joggers, in-line skaters, musicians and tourists on warm weekends, it’s quieter on weekday afternoons, especially in less well-trodden spots above 72nd St such as the Harlem Meer and the North Meadow (north of 97th St).Folks flock to the park even in winter, when snowstorms inspire cross-country skiing and sledding or just a simple stroll through the white wonderland, and crowds turn out every New Year’s Eve for a midnight run. The Central Park Conservancy offers ever-changing guided tours of the park, including ones that focus on public art, wildlife and places of interest to kids.	6am-1am	['6:00 - 25:00', '30:00 - 49:00', '54:00 - 73:00', '78:00 - 97:00', '102:00 - 121:00', '126:00 - 145:00', '150:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 1:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/e169d0c6394f2e1f46eea3f653f2b7b4-central-park.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.centralparknyc.org	True	False	210		['Park']	['Scenic Walking Areas', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	-73.9660514936	40.7824938935	6.5	4.5	['37895', '9619', '1459', '140', '55']	59th & 110th Sts	59th to 110th Street, , New York City, 10022	True	1	210	[]
Brooklyn Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	This encyclopedic museum is housed in a five-story, 560,000-sq-ft beaux-arts building designed by McKim, Mead  White. Today, the building houses more than 1.5 million objects, including ancient artifacts, 19th-century period rooms, and sculptures and painting from across several centuries. The museum offers a great alternative to the packed-to-the-gills institutions in Manhattan, and it often features thought-provoking temporary exhibitions. The first Saturday of the month (except September) features special events (live music, performance art) when the museum stays open until 11pm.  	Construction on the building began in the early 1890s (when Brooklyn was still independent) and the intention had been to make it the largest single-site museum in the world. But the plan lost steam in 1898, when Brooklyn was incorporated into New York.  	11am-6pm Wed & Fri-Sun, to 10pm Thu	['83:00 - 90:00', '107:00 - 118:00', '11:00 - 18:00', '131:00 - 138:00', '155:00 - 162:00']		http://www.brooklynmuseum.org	True	False	120	suggested donation $16	['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'History Museums', 'Museums']	-73.9639708	40.67159345	6.5	4.5	['555', '210', '48', '8', '2']	200 Eastern Pkwy	200 Eastern Pkwy, , Brooklyn, 11238-6099	True	10		[]
National September 11 Memorial Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	Just beyond the reflective pools of the September 11 Memorial is the National September 11 Memorial Museum. Architecturally intriguing and deeply moving, its collection of artifacts, video, photographs and audio create a dignified, reflective exploration of the day of the tragedy, the events that preceded it (including the WTC bombing of 1993), and the stories of grief, resilience and hope that followed.  	From the museum's glass entry pavilion – which eerily evokes a toppled tower – escalators lead to the museum's subterranean galleries. On the descent, visitors stand in the shadow of two 70ft-high steel tridents, originally embedded in the bedrock at the base of the North Tower. Looking like giant, rusty forks, these scorched survivors are two of many objects that bear silent witness to the attacks. Among them is the so-called 'survivors staircase,' used by hundreds of workers to flee the WTC site. There's the last steel column removed from the clean-up, adorned with the messages and mementos of recovery workers, responders and loved ones of the victims. And then there's the New York City Fire Department’s Engine Company 21, its burnt-out cab a piercing testament to the inferno faced by those at the scene.    The most haunting exhibition is arguably In Memoriam, its walls lined with the names and photos of those who perished. Interactive touch screens and a central reflection room offer more comprehensive information about the victims.

Tompkins Square Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	This 10.5-acre park is like a friendly town square for locals, who gather for chess at concrete tables, picnics on the lawn on warm days and spontaneous guitar or drum jams on various grassy knolls. It’s also the site of basketball courts, a fun-to-watch dog run (a fenced-in area where humans can unleash their canines), a public swimming pool, frequent summer concerts and an always-lively kids’ playground.	The park wasn’t always a place for such clean fun. In the ’80s, it was a dirty, needle-strewn homeless encampment, unusable for folks wanting a place to stroll or picnic. A contentious turning point came when police razed the band shell (where the legendary and now-defunct Wigstock dragfest was founded by Lady Bunny and cohorts) and evicted more than 100 squatters living in a tent city in the park in 1988 (and again in 1991). That first eviction turned violent; the Tompkins Square Riot, as it came to be known, ushered in the first wave of yuppies in the dog run, fashionistas lolling in the grass and undercover narcotics agents trying to pass as druggie punk kids.There’s not much drama here these days, unless you count the annual Howl! Festival of East Village Arts, which brings Allen Ginsberg–inspired theater, music, film, dance and spoken-word events to the park and various neighborhood venues each September. The Charlie Parker Jazz Festival is also held here, bringing some of the biggest jazz names to the ’hood each August.

The museum also hosts a range of cultural programs, including dance and music performances, readings for children, craft demonstrations, films and workshops.

Fraunces Tavern Museum	usa	new-york-city	activity	Combining five early-18th-century structures, this unique museum/restaurant/bar pays homage to the nation-shaping events of 1783, when the British relinquished control of New York at the end of the Revolutionary War, and General George Washington gave a farewell speech to the officers of the Continental Army in the 2nd-floor dining room on December 4.	The site was originally built as a tony residence for merchant Stephen Delancey’s family; barkeeper Samuel Fraunces purchased it in 1762, turning it into a tavern in honor of the American victory in the Revolutionary War. After the war, when New York was the nation’s first capital, the space was used by the Departments of War, Treasury and Foreign Affairs. The tavern was closed and fell into disuse in the 19th century – and soon after was damaged during several massive fires that destroyed most colonial buildings and Dutch-built structures in the area. In 1904, the Sons of the Revolution, a historical society, bought the building and returned it to an approximation of its colonial-era look – an act believed to be the first major attempt at historical preservation in the USA. Today, the museum hosts lectures, Revolutionary War paintings, occasional historical walking tours, and some surprising Washington relics, including a lock of hair and a fragment from his original coffin.	noon-5pm Mon-Fri, 11:30am-5pm Sat & Sun	['48:00 - 65:00', '72:00 - 89:00', '96:00 - 113:00', '120:00 - 137:00', '144:00 - 161:00', '11:00 - 17:00', '155:00 - 161:00']		http://www.frauncestavernmuseum.org	False	False	90	adult/6-18yr/under 6yr $7/4/free	['Museum']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.01126827	40.70339405	5.5	4.5	['37', '32', '12', '1', '0']	54 Pearl St	54 Pearl St, , New York City, 10004-4300	True	205		[]

The original Anglican parish church was founded by King William III in 1697 and once presided over several constituent chapels, including St Paul’s Chapel at the corner of Fulton St and Broadway. Its huge landholdings in Lower Manhattan made it the country’s wealthiest and most influential church throughout the 18th century. Burnt down in 1776, its second incarnation was demolished in 1839. The third and current church, designed by English architect Richard Upjohn, helped launch the picturesque neo-Gothic movement in America.	church 7am-6pm Mon-Fri, 8am-4pm Sat, 7am-4pm Sun, churchyard 7am-4pm Mon-Fri, 8am-3pm Sat, 7am-3pm Sun	[]		http://www.trinitywallstreet.org	False	False	90		['Church']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.0121352644	40.7080483372	5.5	4.5	['286', '169', '21', '3', '1']	Broadway	89 Broadway, , New York City, 10006-2003	True	62	90	[]

Beyond it is 'The Room', a contemplative granite terrace with hypnotic skyline and water views.	Kahn's arresting design befits Roosevelt's celebrated speech, in which America's 32nd president addressed his desire for a world based upon four essential human freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.Although the F subway line reaches Roosevelt Island, a much more thrilling way to get here is by tramway car, which glides above the East River from Midtown East.

When dedicated in 1911, New York’s flagship library ranked as the largest marble structure ever built in the US, and to this day, its Rose Main Reading Room steals the breath away with its lavish, coffered ceiling. While the room may be closed for restoration until early 2017, it's only one of several glories, among them the DeWitt Wallace Periodical Room.	This extraordinary building is home to precious manuscripts by just about every author of note in the English language, including an original copy of the Declaration of Independence and a Gutenberg Bible.

Founded in 1838, the cemetery is the final resting place of all kinds of notable personalities.

The event is commemorated by the 7ft statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, who waves to the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The hill is located in the northeast sector of the cemetery, off Battle Ave. Maestro Leonard Bernstein and Brooklyn Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets are both buried in the vicinity.You can pick up a free map at the entrance.

Thirty new acres of island parkland recently opened, with features including 6-acre, art-studded Liggett Terrace; 10-acre Hammock Grove (complete with 50 hammocks); and 14-acre Play Lawn, with natural turf ball fields for adult softball and Little League baseball.	Things get even better in 2017, with the completion of The Hills, an ambitious quartet of man-made hills offering spectacular city and harbor views. Inspiring views are also on tap along the Great Promenade. Running for 2.2 miles along the island's perimeter, the path takes in everything from Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, to Staten Island and New Jersey. Bike rental is available on the island.Besides serving as a successful military fort in the Revolutionary War, the Union Army’s central recruiting station during the Civil War, and the take-off point for Wilbur Wright’s famous 1909 flight around the Statue of Liberty, Governors Island is where the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev summit signaled the beginning of the end of the Cold War. You can visit the spot where that famous summit took place at the Admiral’s House, a grand, colonnaded, 1843 military residence that’s part of the elegant ghost-town area of Nolan Park.Other historic spots include Fort Jay, fortified in 1776 for what became a failed attempt to prevent the Brits from invading Manhattan; Colonel’s Row, a collection of lovely, 19th-century brick officers’ quarters; and the creepy Castle Williams, a 19th-century fort that was eventually used as a military penitentiary. The best way to explore it all is with the National Park Service (www.nps.gov/gois), whose rangers conduct guided tours of the historic district. See the website for specific days and times.For one weekend in June art is in focus as Figment (www.figmentproject.org), an interactive art festival, takes over the island.	10am-6pm Mon-Fri, 10am-7pm Sat & Sun	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '154:00 - 163:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/792a6aafc365af46de5315165c9240e0-al-mirani-fort.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://govisland.com	False	False	210		['Island']	['Historic Sites', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']			5.5	4.5	['276', '138', '29', '2', '2']		New York Harbor, , New York City, 10004	True	55	210	[]

City Hall	usa	new-york-city	activity	This Federal-styled beauty has been home to NYC's government since 1812, and free guided tours of the building run at 10am on Thursdays (reservation obligatory), as well as at noon most Wednesdays. Wednesday tours do not require reservation; simply sign-in between 10am and 11:30am at the NYC Information Center, located at the southern end of City Hall Park. Tours take in the building's elegant coffered rotunda, the City Council chamber, and the Governor’s Room.	It's in the Governor's Room that you'll see portraits by John Trumbull, George Washington’s writing table, and the remnants of a flag flown at the first president’s 1789 inaugural ceremony.Penny-pinching officials neglected to finish City Hall's northern side in marble, finishing the northern facade in brownstone and reducing the size of the building overall. The domed tower was rebuilt in 1917 after being damaged by two fires, and the original marble (and brownstone) facades were replaced with limestone over a granite base in 1954–56. Its beautiful restoration prompted critic Ada Louise Huxtable to call it a ‘symbol of taste, excellence and quality not always matched by the policies inside.’Out front is bustling City Hall Park. Graced with gas lamps, fountains, chess tables and the odd protester. It's a fine place to kick back with a sandwich for a spot of people-watching.	guided tours noon Wed, 10am Thu	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/c0f6bbb2f791de38a001142813127740-city-hall.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www1.nyc.gov/site/designcommission/public-programs/tours/public-tours.page	False	False	90		['Historic Building']	['Government Buildings', 'Visitor Centers', 'Traveler Resources', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.0060080666	40.7127476298	5.0	4.0	['31', '35', '15', '1', '0']	Park Row	Broadway at south end of City Hall Park, , New York City	True	152		[]
Federal Hall	usa	new-york-city	activity	A Greek Revival masterpiece, Federal Hall houses a museum dedicated to postcolonial New York. Themes include George Washington’s inauguration, Alexander Hamilton’s relationship with the city, and the struggles of John Peter Zenger – jailed, tried and acquitted of libel on this site for exposing government corruption in his newspaper. There's also a visitor information hall with city maps and brochures.	Distinguished by a huge statue of George Washington, the building itself stands on the site of New York’s original City Hall, completed in 1703. Remodeled by French engineer Pierre L'Enfant in 1788 and renamed Federal Hall, the building would see Washington taking the oath of office as the first US president on April 30, 1789. (The museum's artifacts include the very slab of stone on which Washington stood while taking that oath.) After that structure’s demolition in 1812, the current building rose in its place between 1834 and 1842, serving as the US Customs House until 1862.	9am-5pm Mon-Fri	['33:00 - 41:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/fbca603faa5bed4946e392436c2daba3-federal-hall.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.nps.gov/feha	False	False	90		['Museum']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-74.010254989	40.7071774805	5.0	4.0	['43', '62', '23', '5', '0']	26 Wall St	26 Wall St, , New York City, 10005-1996	True	121		[]

Instead, you can buy beer tokens ($5 each or five for $20) to sample the refreshing brews. Or you can skip the tour altogether and just while away a weekend afternoon in the bare-bones tasting room.Interesting fact: the brewery’s cursive logo was designed by none other than Milton Glazer, of ‘I Heart New York’ fame, who did the job in exchange for a share of the profits and free beer for life.	tours 5pm Mon-Thu, 1-5pm Sat, 1-4pm Sun; tasting room 6-11pm Fri, noon-8pm Sat, noon-6pm Sun	['24:00 - 42:00', '138:00 - 143:00', '168:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 20:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-542018139_master.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.brooklynbrewery.com	False	False		tours free Sat & Sun, $12 Mon-Thu	['Brewery']	['Breweries', 'Food & Drink']	-73.95735729	40.72163559	5.5	4.5	['176', '88', '40', '8', '4']	79 N 11th St	79 N 11th St, , Brooklyn, 11249-1913	True	16		[]

The circular structure got its current moniker in 1817 to honor then-mayor DeWitt Clinton. Later, and before Ellis Island opened to immigrants, Castle Garden (as it was then known) served as the major processing center for new immigrant arrivals, welcoming more than eight million people between 1855 and 1890.

Kings County Distillery produces bourbon (aged in charred, American oak barrels), moonshine (made of 80% corn, and not nearly as undrinkable as the name might imply) and limited-edition seasonal varieties like pumpkin spice whiskey.

St Patrick's Old Cathedral	usa	new-york-city	activity	Though St Patrick’s Cathedral is now famously located on Fifth Ave in Midtown, its first congregation was housed here, in this recently restored Gothic Revival church. Designed by Joseph-François Mangin and constructed between 1809 and 1815, the church was once the seat of religious life for the Archdiocese of New York, as well as an important community center for new immigrants, mainly from Ireland.	When the church was built, the city hadn't yet spread this far north, the building's calculated isolation a welcome relief from the hostility of the New York's Protestant majority. Anti-Catholic sentiments also led to the construction of the church grounds' brick wall, an attempt to hinder stone-throwers.The church and its beautiful graveyard feature in Martin Scorsese's celluloid classic Mean Streets (1973). It's a spot well-known to the Italian-American auteur, who grew up in nearby Elizabeth St.	6am-9pm	['33:00 - 41:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/a8b6c257d857eef6ef18d85762dc905a56a96389e43a33497b91f062c7bed736/57f4e12ad0be150e0db0b5f46f336220c504280a5b7a88ac4b4567a20e25d347.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.oldcathedral.org	False	False	90		['Church']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-73.995152	40.723421	5.5	4.5	['46', '28', '4', '1', '0']	263 Mulberry St	263 Mulberry St, , New York City, 10012-3375	True	138		[]

The 585-acre Prospect Park, created in 1866, is considered the greatest achievement of landscape designers Olmsted and Vaux, who also designed Central Park.

In the early 1970s, that site was home to the Washington Market, a wholesale fruit and vegetable shopping complex.

Columbus Park	usa	new-york-city	activity	Mah-jongg meisters, slow-motion tai-chi practitioners and old aunties gossiping over homemade dumplings: it might feel like Shanghai, but this leafy oasis is core to NYC history. In the 19th century, this was part of the infamous Five Points neighborhood, the city’s first tenement slums and the inspiration for Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York.	The ‘five points’ were the five streets that used to converge here; now you’ll find the intersection of only Mosco, Worth and Baxter Sts. Aside from serving up an intriguing slice of multicultural life, the park's other perk these days is its public bathroom, making it the perfect place for a pit stop.

Mulberry Street	usa	new-york-city	activity	Named for the mulberry farms that once stood here, Mulberry St is now better known as the meat in Little Italy's sauce. It's an animated strip, packed with smooth-talking restaurant hawkers (especially between Hester and Grand Sts), wisecracking baristas and a healthy dose of kitschy souvenirs.	Despite the neighborhood's many changes over the years, history looms large. It was inside restaurant Da Gennaro, formerly Umberto's Clam House, that 'Crazy Joe' Gallo was gunned down on 2 April 1972, an unexpected birthday surprise for the Brooklyn-born mobster. One block further north stands fourth-generation Alleva, one of the city's original cheese shops and famed for its mozzarella. Across the street on Grand lies another veteran, Ferrara Cafe  Bakery, celebrated for its classic Italian pastries and gelati. Back on Mulberry, old-time Mulberry Street Bar was a favorite haunt of the late Frank Sinatra; its own TV cameos include Law  Order and the Sopranos.Alcohol was openly traded on the corner of Mulberry and Kenmare Sts during Prohibition, leading to its nickname, the 'Curb Exchange.' That police headquarters at the time were only a block away at 240 Centre St is testament to the power of good old-fashioned bribes. From this point north, the old-school delis and restaurants of Little Italy give way to the new-school boutiques, galleries and restaurants of Nolita. Take a gander at what was once the Ravenite Social Club to see how things have really changed around here. Now a designer shoe store, it was once a mobster hangout (originally known as the Alto Knights Social Club). Indeed, it was right here that big hitters such as Lucky Luciano and John Gotti (as well as the FBI, who kept a watchful eye from the building across the street) logged time. Only the shop's tile floor remains from the day, the shop windows once an intimidating brick wall.

Chelsea Hotel	usa	new-york-city	activity	This red-brick hotel, built in the 1880s and featuring ornate iron balconies and no fewer than seven plaques declaring its literary landmark status, has played a major role in pop-culture history. It’s where the likes of Mark Twain, Thomas Wolfe, Dylan Thomas and Arthur Miller hung out; Jack Kerouac allegedly crafted On the Road during one marathon session here, and it’s where Arthur C Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey.	Dylan Thomas died of alcohol poisoning while staying here in 1953, and Nancy Spungen died here after being stabbed by her Sex Pistols boyfriend Sid Vicious in 1978. Among the many celebs who have logged time living at the Chelsea are Joni Mitchell, Stanley Kubrick, Dennis Hopper, Edith Piaf, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, whose song ‘Chelsea Hotel’ recalls a romp with Janis Joplin (who spent time here, too).Sadly, the hotel's days of artistry and intrigue are long gone.

New York University	usa	new-york-city	activity	In 1831 Albert Gallatin, formerly Secretary of the Treasury under President Thomas Jefferson, founded an intimate center of higher learning open to all students, regardless of race or class background. He’d scarcely recognize the place today, as it’s swelled to a student population of around 50,000, with more than 16,000 employees, and schools and colleges at six Manhattan locations.	It just keeps growing, too – to the dismay of landmark activists and business owners, who have seen buildings rapidly bought out by the academic giant (or destroyed through careless planning, such as with the historic Province­town Playhouse) and replaced with ugly dormitories or administrative offices. Still, some of its crevices are charming, such as the leafy courtyard at its School of Law, or impressively modern, like the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, where top-notch dance, theater, music, spoken-word and other performers wow audiences at the 850-seat theater. NYU’s academic offerings are highly regarded and wide-ranging, especially its film, theater, writing, medical and law programs. For a unique experience that will put you on the fast track to meeting locals, sign up for a weekend or one-day class – from American history to photography – offered by the School of Professional Studies and Continuing Education, and open to all.

Q4 Hotel	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Cheap, clean and steps from the subway – it's hard to argue with this no-frills hostel. Even if it has no phone (very millennial!) and rooms can be a little rattly from the elevated train going by out front. Dorms have between two beds (fine) and eight (cramped); private queen rooms are an option.

Chelsea Pines Inn	usa	new-york-city	hotel	With its five walk-up floors coded to the rainbow flag, the 26-room Chelsea Pines is serious gay-and-lesbian central, but guests of all stripes are welcome. It helps to be up on your Hitchcock beauties, as vintage movie posters not only plaster the walls but rooms are named for starlets such as Kim Novak, Doris Day and Ann-Margret.	There’s a sink in the walk-in closet of standard rooms, with clean bathrooms down the hall. The small lounge downstairs opens to a tiny courtyard out back and breakfast is included in the rates.

Murray Hill East Suites	usa	new-york-city	hotel	The dated brick facade is a suitable introduction to the rooms, where uninspiring furniture and carpet page the eras of flares and shoulder pads. If you can overlook the design shortcomings, you'll enjoy remarkably spacious quarters, with separate sitting areas and kitchenettes. A plethora of great eating and drinking options are nearby. The catch: a minimum 30-day stay.

The French Quarters	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Wrought-iron balconies, exposed brick walls and faux French-colonial decor: French Quarters brings a dash of the Big Easy to the Big Apple. Rooms and suites range from snug to spacious, with the one- and two-bedroom suites ideal for longer stays. All rooms offer luxury linens, kitchenette and complimentary wi-fi. The usual Manhattan minuses apply: namely street noise and small standard rooms. Staff receive mixed reviews.

Hotel Newton	usa	new-york-city	hotel	The nine-story Newton isn’t going to win any interior-design awards, but it’s clean and managed well, making it a solid budget option. The 110 guest rooms are small but tidy, and come stocked with TVs, mini-refrigerators, coffee makers and microwaves. The bathrooms are all well-maintained. Larger ‘suites’ are roomier and feature a sitting area. Wi-fi costs extra.

Pod 39	usa	new-york-city	hotel	It's a case of good things coming in very small packages at funky Pod 39. The sibling of budget-luxe Pod 51, its 366 rooms offer hip-n-functional design, private bathroom and city views in Pod's trademark tiny dimensions. Cranking up the Millennial cred is a Technicolor taqueria, eclectic lobby lounge, light-strung rooftop bar, and games room (complete with oh-so-retro ping-pong table).

Hotel Metro	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Imbued with a faint whiff of 1930s art deco, the 181-room, 13-floor Metro offers somewhat plain but undeniably comfortable rooms, with caramel color schemes, flatscreen TVs and more thinking space than most hotels in its price range.

The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Housed in a lone 19th-century, five-story townhouse on busy 23rd St, this 14-room BB is a Chelsea gem. Bought in 1998 and extensively renovated by the Fisherman family (who wisely installed an elevator), the rooms are big and welcoming, with fanciful fabrics on big brass or poster beds and TVs held in huge armoires.	There’s an honor-system bar and an ol’ piano for you to play boogie-woogie on in the lounge, and a 2nd-floor, all-Victorian library that doubles as a breakfast room.

Hotel Le Jolie	usa	new-york-city	hotel	An unremarkable 54-room hotel sitting alongside the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (leading some locals to call it ‘Le Hotel BQE’), but it's comfortable and reasonable. Rooms are sleek, with beds sporting monolithic 2001: A Space Odyssey–like headboards. There are iPod docks and flat-screen TVs. But the real deal here is the proximity to Williamsburg nightlife.	Rooms on the upper stories with Manhattan views are best.

Hotel Pennsylvania	usa	new-york-city	hotel	When it opened in 1919, the Hotel Pennsylvania was the largest hotel in the world. Although it's lost its title (and much of its luster), this place still feels vast, with a seemingly endless maze of guestrooms spread across 18 floors. Despite not having the most comfortable beds in town, rooms are adequate and fair value, with some offering views of the Empire State Building.

Hotel 17	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Right off Stuyvesant Sq, this popular, eight-floor townhouse is where Woody Allen shot a frightening dead-body scene for his film Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993). The 120 rooms are small and basic, with old-school chintzy furnishings and a lack of natural light, and only four have private bathrooms (but all are free of dead bodies).	If this place is booked, ask about its sister property in Midtown, Hotel 31.

The Jane	usa	new-york-city	hotel	The claustrophobic will want to avoid the Jane’s tiny 50-sq-ft rooms, but if you can stomach living like a luxury sailor, check into this renovated red-brick gem, which was built for mariners in the early 20th century (survivors from the Titanic also stayed here in 1912).	The small cabin rooms have shared bathrooms; the more expensive captain’s quarters come with private commodes. The gorgeous ballroom/bar looks like it belongs in a five-star hotel.

Hotel 31	usa	new-york-city	hotel	A lo-fi budget option in Midtown East, Hotel 31 and no public area or breakfast.

Park Savoy Hotel	usa	new-york-city	hotel	The best thing about the Park Savoy is the low price and nifty location near the lovely gateway of Central Park. More money saved on lodgings means more to spend at nearby Fifth Ave boutiques and top Broadway shows. Naturally, there is a trade-off and that's the rooms: worn carpets, cheap bedspreads, and showers with trickling water pressure, to say nothing of the unhelpful staff.

Serenity at Home	usa	new-york-city	hotel	A short stroll from Prospect Park in Brooklyn, this charming guesthouse is set in a lovely pre-war row house. Each of four guestrooms has wooden floors, attractive furnishings and high-quality mattresses and bedding. Note that three rooms share bathrooms, while there's one spacious room with its own private bathroom (boasting a clawfoot tub no less).	Zenobia, the owner, makes guests feel right at home, and has loads of useful advice for exploring the neighborhood and the city beyond. Minimum three-night stay.

International Student Center	usa	new-york-city	hotel	Set in a converted brownstone just a short stroll from Central Park, ISC has simple dorm rooms and basic facilities, with a cozy, if well-worn, lounge on the ground floor. The hosts are friendly, but the rules can be annoying: you can't bring bags up to the rooms, and only guests aged 18 to 35 are accepted.	Lack of wi-fi is a big minus (there is a computer, not free, for guests). The location, however, is outstanding.

Carlton Arms Hotel	usa	new-york-city	hotel	If only these walls could talk… The Carlton Arms has gone through many incarnations during its 100 years as a hotel, from nights of subterfuge (the lobby was a speakeasy during Prohibition) to days of dereliction (as a refuge for addicts and prostitutes in the 1960s). These days the Carlton Arms feels equal parts art gallery and budget hotel.	Artwork adorns the interiors, with murals following the walls up five flights of stairs, and into each of the tiny guest rooms and shared bathrooms (there is a small sink in each guest room). Not surprisingly, it draws an eclectic mix of Bohemian travelers, who don’t mind the rustic accommodations in exchange for big savings. Prepare to work those legs: there’s no lift.
