Houhai Lakes	china	beijing	activity	Also known as Shíchàhǎi (什刹海) but mostly just referred to collectively as ‘Hòuhǎi’, the Hòuhǎi Lakes are compromised of three lakes: Qiánhǎi (Front Lake), Hòuhǎi (Back Lake) and Xīhǎi (West Lake). Together they are one of the capital’s favourite outdoor spots, heaving with locals and out-of-towners in the summer especially, and providing great people-spotting action.	During the day, senior citizens meander along, use the exercise machines scattered along the lakeshore, fish, fly kites or just sit and chew the fat. At night, the area turns into one of the more popular nightlife areas, as the restaurants, bars and cafes that surround the lakes spring into life. This is a night out, Chinese style, so be prepared for neon lights galore, and plenty of karaoke being blasted out onto the surrounding lanes. Meanwhile, as the midday sun disappears, the lakes become a mass of pedalos circling round and round.It’s great fun, and even if you find parts of the lakes too hectic (Silver Ingot Bridge is a major bottleneck), it's easy enough to escape the crowds, by exploring the many hútòng that run both east and west of the lakes, or to just venture further northwest towards the quieter Xīhǎi Lake. It’s particularly good to cycle around and numerous places by the lakeshores hire out bikes by the hour (¥10 per hour, ¥200 deposit). There are many spots to rent pedalos too (¥120 per hour, ¥300 deposit), if you want to take to the water. Some locals swim in the lakes, even in midwinter!The lakes look majestic in winter, when they freeze over and become the best place in Běijīng to ice skate (usually for around six weeks in January and February). Qiánhǎi Lake is most popular, although some people skate on Hòuhǎi Lake too; local vendors set themselves up with all the gear you need. You have to pay to enter the ice-skating area (weekdays/weekends ¥35/40 including skate hire). There's also chair sleds, ice bikes and even ice bumper cars to rent, and a giant ice slide.

Tian'anmen Square	china	beijing	activity	Flanked by stern 1950s Soviet-style buildings and ringed by white perimeter fences, the world’s largest public square (440,000 sq metres) is an immense flatland of paving stones at the heart of Běijīng. If you get up early, you can watch the flagraising ceremony at sunrise, performed by a troop of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers drilled to march at precisely 108 paces per minute, 75cm per pace. The soldiers emerge through the Gate of Heavenly Peace to goosestep impeccably across Chang’an Jie; all traffic is halted. The same ceremony in reverse is performed at sunset.	Here one stands at the symbolic centre of the Chinese universe. The rectangular arrangement, flanked by halls to both east and west, to some extent echoes the layout of the Forbidden City: as such, the square employs a conventional plan that pays obeisance to traditional Chinese culture, but many of its ornaments and buildings are Soviet-inspired. Mao conceived the square to project the enormity of the Communist Party, and during the Cultural Revolution he reviewed parades of up to a million people here. The ‘Tiān’ānmén Incident’, in 1976, is the term given to the near-riot in the square that accompanied the death of Premier Zhou Enlai. Another million people jammed the square to pay their last respects to Mao in the same year. Most infamously, in 1989 the army forced prodemocracy demonstrators out of the square. Hundreds lost their lives in the surrounding streets, although contrary to widespread belief, it is unlikely that anyone was killed in the square itself.Despite being a public place, the square remains more in the hands of the government than the people; it is monitored by closed circuit TV cameras, Segway-riding policemen and plain-clothes officers. The designated points of access, security checks on entry (expect a lengthy wait) and twitchy mood cleave Tiān’ānmén Sq from the city. A tangible atmosphere of restraint and authority reigns.All this – plus the absence of anywhere to sit – means the square is hardly a place to chill out (don’t whip out a guitar), but such is its iconic status that few people leave Běijīng without making a visit. In any case, there’s more than enough space to stretch a leg and the view can be breathtaking, especially on a clear blue day or at nightfall when the area is illuminated.

Workers Cultural Palace	china	beijing	activity	Despite the prosaic name and its location at the very heart of town, this reclusive park, between Tiān’ānmén Sq and the Forbidden City, is one of Běijīng’s best-kept secrets. Few visitors divert here from their course towards the main gate of the Forbidden City, but this was the emperor’s premier place of worship and contains the Sacrificial Hall; as exquisite as any temple you'll find in Běijīng.	If you find the Forbidden City either too colossal or crowded, the temple halls here are a cheaper, more tranquil and more manageable alternative. Enter the temple area of the park through the striking Glazed Gate (琉璃门; Liúli Mén). Then, rising up to the splendid Sacrificial Hall are three flights of steps. Only gods could traverse the central plinth; the emperor was consigned to the left-hand flight. Note how the plaque above the Sacrificial Hall is inscribed in both Chinese and Manchu. Its space is now used to host temporary cultural exhibitions; be sure to look up to admire its beautifully carved interior roofing.The northern perimeter of the park abuts the palace moat, where you can find a bench and park yourself in front of a fine view. There's also a south gate, for Tiān'ānmén Sq, and a northwest gate, for the Forbidden City, and east gate for restaurants.	6.30am-7.30pm	['6:30 - 19:30', '30:30 - 43:30', '54:30 - 67:30', '78:30 - 91:30', '102:30 - 115:30', '126:30 - 139:30', '150:30 - 163:30']			True	False	90	park entrance ¥2, Sacrificial Hall ¥15	['Park']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Civic Centers', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.394085	39.908304	6.5	4.5	['17', '13', '1', '1', '0']		East of Tian'anmen, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100006	True	94		[]
798 Art District	china	beijing	activity	A vast area of disused factories built by the East Germans, 798 Art District, also known as Dàshānzi (大山子), is Běijīng’s main concentration of contemporary art galleries. The industrial complex celebrates its proletarian roots in the communist heyday of the 1950s via the retouched red Maoist slogans decorating gallery walls and statues of burly, lantern-jawed workers dotting the lanes. The giant former factory workshops are ideally suited to multimedia installations and other ambitious projects.	You could easily spend half a day wandering around the complex. There are signboards with English-language maps to guide you around.Some of the bigger galleries include the 798 Art Factory, a Bauhaus hangar-like space with its ceiling decorated in 1950s Maoist slogans, and original machinery scattered among changing art exhibitions by Chinese and foreign artists. The Danish gallery Faurschou Foundation Beijing has exhibitions by internationally acclaimed artists, with past shows including the likes of Lucien Freud, Ai Wei Wei, Andy Warhol and Yoko Ono. Springs Centre of the Arts also exhibits headliner artists from both China and abroad. UCCA is another big-money gallery with immense, modern exhibition halls and the attached cool UCCA Design Store.Other highlights include the Xin Dong Cheng Space for Contemporary Art which showcases young avant-garde Chinese artists in a lovely space; Zhu Bingren Art Museum features the copper and bronze sculpture of renowned Shandong artist Zhu Bingren. Also check out the Pyongyang-based Mansudae Art Studio, which exhibits North Korean artists and sells DPRK collectibles.There are also plenty of quirky open-air sculptures scattered around the site. The caged dinosaurs out front of 798 Art Factory are popular, while original socialist realism sculptures in the southwest of the complex include a headless Chairman Mao statue. Nearby are shipping containers used as a canvas by graffiti artists. The area around 798 Live House is the best for stencils, murals and other street art.	galleries 10am-6pm, most closed Mon	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/e0b24c3329a55246957652dbc1f2fe671436492bec0fa9bf01f2d3eedfe98260/653f78703bc010df7baa9ca0100f0151a67b636a09fe07860bbbda17f8c24fe8.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	90		['Gallery']	['Art Galleries', 'Neighborhoods', 'Museums', 'Shopping', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.4839489	39.98446258	6.5	4.5	['473', '291', '96', '26', '11']	cnr Jiuxianqiao Lu & Jiuxianqiao Beilu; 酒仙桥路	No.4 Jiuxianqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100015	True	21	90	[]
Beihai Park	china	beijing	activity	Běihǎi Park, northwest of the Forbidden City, is largely occupied by the North Sea (běihǎi), a huge lake fringed by willows that freezes in winter and blooms with lotuses in summer. Old folk dance together outside temple halls and come twilight, young couples cuddle on benches. It’s a restful place to stroll around, rent a rowing boat in summer and watch calligraphers practising characters on paving slabs with fat brushes and water.  	Topping Jade Islet (琼岛; Qióngdǎo) on the lake, the 36m-high Tibetan-style White Dagoba was built in 1651 for a visit by the Dalai Lama, and was rebuilt in 1741. Climb up to the dagoba via the Yǒng’ān Temple (永安寺; Yǒng’ān Sì).    The site is associated with Kublai Khan’s palace, Běijīng’s navel before the arrival of the Forbidden City. All that survives of the Khan’s court is a large jar made of green jade in the Round City, near the southern entrance. Also within the Round City is the Chengguang Hall (Chéngguāng Diàn), where a white jade statue of Sakyamuni from Myanmar (Burma) can be found, its arm wounded by the allied forces that swarmed through Běijīng in 1900 to quash the Boxer Rebellion.    Located on the lake’s northern shore, Xītiān Fánjìng is one of the most interesting temples in Běijīng, though it was closed for major renovations in 2016 with ongoing works. The first hall, the Hall of the Heavenly Kings, takes you past Mílèfó, Weituo and the four Heavenly Kings. The nearby Nine Dragon Screen, a 5m-high and 27m-long spirit wall, is a glimmering stretch of coloured glazed tiles depicting coiling dragons, similar to its counterpart in the Forbidden City. West, along the shore, is the unique Xiaoxitian, the largest square pavilion-style palace in China. Its centrepiece features a rather garish diorama of Mt Sumeru with Bodhisattva seated at its peak along with arhats on rocky outcrops.    Attached to the North Sea, the South (Nánhǎi) and Middle (Zhōnghǎi) Seas to the south lend their name to Zhōngnánhǎi (literally ‘Middle and South Seas’), the heavily-guarded compound less than a mile south of the park where the Chinese Communist Party’s top leadership live.  	6am-9pm, sights to 5pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/74968053.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.beihaipark.com.cn/en	True	False	30	admission high/low season ¥10/5, through ticket high/low season ¥20/15, audio guide ¥60	['Park']	['Bodies of Water', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.383433421	39.9249505534	6.5	4.5	['441', '310', '67', '7', '1']		No.1 Wenjin Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100000	True	16	30	[]
Qianmen	china	beijing	activity	Qianmen, aka Front Gate, actually consists of two gates. The northernmost of the two gates is the 40m-high Zhèngyáng Gate (正阳门城楼; Zhèngyáng Mén Chénglóu), which dates from the Ming dynasty and which was the largest of the nine gates of the Inner City Wall separating the inner, or Tartar (Manchu) city from the outer, or Chinese city. With the disappearance of the city walls, the gate sits out of context, but it can be climbed for decent views of the square and of Arrow Tower, immediately to the south.  	Partially destroyed in the Boxer Rebellion around 1900, the gate was once flanked by two temples that have since vanished. Inside the upper levels are some fascinating historical photographs, showing the area as it was at the beginning of the last century, before the city walls and many of the surrounding gates and temples were demolished. Explanatory captions are in English as well as Chinese.    The second gate, the Zhèngyáng Gate Arrow Tower, directly south, can’t be climbed. It also dates from the Ming dynasty and was originally connected to Zhèngyáng Gate by a semicircular enceinte (demolished last century).  	9am-4pm Tue-Sun	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/1aee7ca8d493d4633dc086e1e05835b5-pyramids-of-giza.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	90	admission ¥20, audio guide ¥20	['Historic Site']	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.391644918	39.8990392991	6.0	4.0	['24', '33', '15', '4', '1']		North of Qianmen Street, Beijing, 100050	True	64	90	[]

Drum Tower	china	beijing	activity	Along with the older-looking Bell Tower, which stands behind it, the magnificent red-painted Drum Tower used to be the city’s official timekeeper, with drums and bells beaten and rung to mark the times of the day. Originally built in 1272, the Drum Tower was once the heart of the Mongol capital of Dàdū, as Běijīng was then known. It was destroyed in a fire before a replacement was built, slightly to the east of the original location, in 1420. The current structure is a Qing-dynasty version of that 1420 tower.	You can climb the steep inner staircase for views of the grey-tiled rooftops in the surrounding hútòng alleys. But, you can’t view the Bell Tower as the north-facing balcony has been closed. It’s well worth climbing the tower, though, especially if you can time it to coincide with one of the regular drumming performances, which are played out on reproductions of the 25 Ming-dynasty watch drums, which used to sound out across this part of the city. One of the original 25 drums, the Night Watchman’s Drum (更鼓; Gēnggǔ), is on display; dusty, battered and torn. Also on display is a replica of a Song-dynasty water clock, which was never actually used in the tower, but is interesting nonetheless.The times of the drumming performances, which only last for a few minutes, are at 9.30am, 10.30am, 11.30am, 1.30pm, 2.30pm, 3.30pm and 4.45pm.	9am-5pm, last tickets 4.40pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/c67d52d6c4d4fa383e76a3bf5af84c390ef3cd703fa74a258cd2333ec3a6921a/d8ef5f1dbc29d0e2dfb664451dfcd804af3019aa989083f51bf725c869ee834e.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	30	admission ¥20, both towers through ticket ¥30	['Historic Site']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.389606027	39.9393640391	6.0	4.0	['99', '174', '78', '10', '0']	Gulou Dongdajie; 鼓楼东大街	Di'anmen Wai Main Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100006	True	37	30	[]
Gate of Heavenly Peace	china	beijing	activity	Characterised by a giant framed portrait of Mao Zedong, and guarded by two pairs of Ming stone lions, the double-eaved Gate of Heavenly Peace, north of Tiān’ānmén Square, is a potent national symbol. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, the gate was formerly the largest of the four gates of the Imperial City Wall, and it was from this gate that Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China on 1 October 1949. Today’s political coterie watches mass troop parades from here.	Climb the gate for excellent views of the square, and peek inside at the impressive beams and overdone paintwork; in all there are 60 gargantuan wooden pillars and 17 vast lamps suspended from the ceiling. Within the gate tower there is also a fascinating photographic history of the gate and Tiān’ānmén Sq, and footage of military parades.There’s no fee for walking through the gate, en route to the Forbidden City, but if you climb it you’ll have to pay. The ticket office is on the north side of the gate; here you'll need to stow all bags before entering. For Forbidden City tickets, keep walking about 600m further north.	8.30am-4.30pm, to 4pm Nov-Mar	['5:00 - 22:00', '29:00 - 46:00', '53:00 - 70:00', '77:00 - 94:00', '101:00 - 118:00', '125:00 - 142:00', '149:00 - 166:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/bb19b040f7546bc4c7f6c14e1ef9bb4aa17a168310477a8a13ffaaf568e51111/a568ed7dd3814bcf6a3e8f8597791043e3da7fcf1b7e353cbd857285b352ae85.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	90	admission ¥15, bag storage ¥3-6	['Historic Site']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.391199	39.907341	6.5	4.5	['172', '184', '65', '7', '4']	Xichang'an Jie; 西长安街	North of Tian'anmen square, Dongcheng District, Beijing	True	22		[]
Summer Palace	china	beijing	activity	As mandatory a Běijīng sight as the Great Wall or the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace was the playground for emperors fleeing the suffocating summer torpor of the old imperial city. A marvel of design, the palace – with its huge lake and hilltop views – offers a pastoral escape into the landscapes of traditional Chinese painting. It merits an entire day’s exploration, although a (high-paced) morning or afternoon exploring the temples, gardens, pavilions, bridges and corridors may suffice.	The domain had long been a royal garden before being considerably enlarged and embellished by Emperor Qianlong in the 18th century. He marshalled a 100,000-strong army of labourers to deepen and expand Kūnmíng Lake (昆明湖; Kūnmíng Hú), and reputedly surveyed imperial navy drills from a hilltop perch.Anglo-French troops vandalised the palace during the Second Opium War (1856–60). Empress Dowager Cixi launched into a refit in 1888 with money earmarked for a modern navy; the marble boat at the northern edge of the lake was her only nautical, albeit quite unsinkable, concession. Foreign troops, angered by the Boxer Rebellion, had another go at torching the Summer Palace in 1900, prompting further restoration work. By 1949 the palace had once more fallen into disrepair, eliciting a major overhaul.Glittering Kūnmíng Lake swallows up three-quarters of the park, overlooked by Longevity Hill (万寿山; Wànshòu Shān). The principal structure is the Hall of Benevolence  Longevity, by the east gate, housing a hardwood throne and attached to a courtyard decorated with bronze animals, including the mythical qílín (a hybrid animal that only appeared on earth at times of harmony). Unfortunately, the hall is barricaded so you can only peer in.An elegant stretch of woodwork along the northern shore, the Long Corridor is trimmed with a plethora of paintings, while the slopes and crest of Longevity Hill behind are adorned with Buddhist temples. Slung out uphill on a north-south axis, the Buddhist Fragrance Pavilion and the Cloud Dispelling Hall are linked by corridors. Crowning the peak is the Buddhist Temple of the Sea of Wisdom, tiled with effigies of Buddha, many with obliterated heads.Cixi’s marble boat sits immobile on the north shore, south of some fine Qing boathouses. When the lake is not frozen, you can traverse Kūnmíng Lake by ferry to South Lake Island (南湖岛; Nánhú Dǎo), where Cixi went to beseech the Dragon King Temple for rain in times of drought. A graceful 17-arch bridge spans the 150m to the eastern shore of the lake. In warm weather, pedal boats are also available from the dock.Try to do a circuit of the lake along the West Causeway to return along the east shore (or vice versa). It gets you away from the crowds, the views are gorgeous and it’s a great cardiovascular workout. Based on the Su Causeway in Hángzhōu, and lined with willow and mulberry trees, the causeway kicks off just west of the boathouses. With its delightful hump, the grey- and white-marble Jade Belt Bridge dates from the reign of emperor Qianlong and crosses the point where the Jade River (Yùhé) enters the lake (when it flows).Towards the North Palace Gate, Sūzhōu Street (苏州街; Sūzhōu Jiē) is an entertaining and light-hearted diversion of riverside walkways, shops and eateries, which are designed to mimic the famous Jiāngsū canal town.	7am-7pm, sights 8am-5pm summer, 8.30am-4.30pm winter	['6:30 - 18:00', '30:30 - 42:00', '54:30 - 66:00', '78:30 - 90:00', '102:30 - 114:00', '126:30 - 138:00', '150:30 - 162:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/eb256de36c6d179d6a6a942382725465-summer-palace.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	True	210	Apr-Oct ¥30, through ticket ¥60, Nov-Mar ¥20, through ticket ¥50, audio guide ¥40	['Historic Site']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Castles', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.2679616	39.99715031	6.5	4.5	['3505', '2062', '448', '53', '16']	19 Xinjian Gongmen; 新建宫门19号	19 Xin-jian-gong-men Rd, Haidian District, Beijing, 100084	False	4	210	[]
Temple of Heaven Park	china	beijing	activity	A tranquil oasis of peace and methodical Confucian design in one of China’s busiest urban landscapes, the 267-hectare Temple of Heaven Park is absolutely unique. It originally served as a vast stage for solemn rites performed by the emperor of the time (known as the Son of Heaven), who prayed here for good harvests and sought divine clearance and atonement. Strictly speaking, it's an altar rather than a temple – so don’t expect burning incense or worshippers.	Surrounded by a long wall and with a gate at each compass point, the arrangement is typical of Chinese parks, with the imperfections, bumps and wild irregularities of nature largely deleted and the harmonising hand of man accentuated in obsessively straight lines and regular arrangements. This effect is magnified by Confucian objectives, where the human intellect is imposed on the natural world, fashioning order and symmetry. The resulting balance and harmony have an almost haunting – but slightly claustrophobic – beauty. Police whir about in electric buggies as visitors stroll among old buildings, groves of ancient trees and birdsong. Around 4000 ancient, knotted cypresses (some 800 years old, their branches propped up on poles) poke towards the Běijīng skies within the grounds.Seen from above, the temple halls are round and the bases square, in accordance with the notion ‘Tiānyuán Dìfāng’ (天圆地方) – ‘Heaven is round, Earth is square’. Also observe that the northern rim of the park is semicircular, while its southern end is square. The traditional approach to the temple was from the south, via Zhāohēng Gate (昭亨门; Zhāohēng Mén); the north gate is an architectural afterthought. The highlight of the park, and an icon of Běijīng in its own right, is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, an astonishing structure with a triple-eaved purplish-blue umbrella roof mounted on a three-tiered marble terrace. The wooden pillars (made from Oregon fir) support the ceiling without nails or cement – for a building 38m high and 30m in diameter, that’s quite an accomplishment. Embedded in the ceiling is a carved dragon, a symbol of the emperor. Built in 1420, the hall was reduced to carbon after being zapped by a lightning bolt during the reign of Guangxu in 1889; a faithful reproduction based on Ming architectural methods was erected the following year.Continuing south along an elevated imperial pathway, you soon reach the octagonal Imperial Vault of Heaven, which was erected in 1530 and rebuilt in 1752, but with its shape echoing the lines of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. The hall contained tablets of the emperor’s ancestors, employed during winter solstice ceremonies.Wrapped around the Imperial Vault of Heaven is Echo Wall. A whisper can travel clearly from one end to your friend’s ear at the other – unless a cacophonous tour group joins in (get here early for this one).Immediately south of Echo Wall, the 5m-high Round Altar was constructed at the same time as the Imperial Vault of Heaven and rebuilt in 1740. Consisting of white marble arrayed in three tiers, its geometry revolves around the imperial number nine. Odd numbers possess heavenly significance, with nine the largest single-digit odd number. Symbolising heaven, the top tier is a huge mosaic of nine rings, each composed of multiples of nine stones, so that the ninth ring equals 81 stones. The stairs and balustrades are similarly presented in multiples of nine. Sounds generated from the centre of the upper terrace undergo amplification from the marble balustrades (the acoustics can get noisy when crowds join in).Off to the eastern side of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, and with a green-tiled two-tier roof, the Animal Killing Pavilion was the venue for the slaughter of sacrificial oxen, sheep, deer and other animals. Today it stands locked and passive but can be admired from the outside. Stretching out from here runs a Long Corridor, where locals sit and deal cards, listen to the radio, play keyboards, practise Peking opera, try dance moves and play jiànzi, a game similar to hacky-sack but played with a weighted shuttlecock. Just north of here is a large and very popular exercise park.In the west of the park, sacrificial music was rehearsed at the Divine Music Administration, while feral cats inhabit the dry moat of the green-tiled Fasting Palace.The East Gate is the most popular place to enter the park but queues for tickets are shorter at the West Gate.	park 6.30am-10pm, sights 8am-5.30pm Apr-Oct, park 6.30am-8pm, sights 8am-5pm Nov-Mar	['6:00 - 20:00', '30:00 - 44:00', '54:00 - 68:00', '78:00 - 92:00', '102:00 - 116:00', '126:00 - 140:00', '150:00 - 164:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/7d17a3ca32132ece9d22b9b5553eb1ac-temple-of-heaven-park.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	True	90	park/through ticket Apr-Oct ¥15/35, Nov-Mar ¥10/30, audio tour ¥40 (deposit ¥50)	['Park']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.3998776	39.88413287	6.5	4.5	['2681', '1799', '434', '37', '13']	Tiantan Donglu; 天坛东路	Tiantan Road, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100050	False	6	90	[]
Forbidden City	china	beijing	activity	Ringed by a 52m-wide moat at the very heart of Běijīng, the Forbidden City is China’s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings, and the largest palace complex in the world. So called because it was off limits for 500 years, when it was steeped in stultifying ritual and Byzantine regal protocol, the otherworldly palace was the reclusive home to two dynasties of imperial rule until the Republic overthrew the last Qing emperor. It's a Unesco World Heritage–listed site since 1987. Open daily July and August.	The Forbidden City is prosaically known as the Palace Museum (故宫博物馆; Gùgōng Bówùguǎn), although most Chinese people simply call it Gù Gōng (故宫; ancient palace). 'Forbidden City' is an approximation of the Chinese 紫禁城 (Zǐjìn Chéng), a more poetic moniker that also references the colour purple and the cosmically significant North Star, the ‘celestial seat’ of the emperor.In former ages, the price for uninvited admission was instant execution, although mere mortals wouldn't have even got close because the Imperial City enclosing the Forbidden City with yet another set of huge walls was also off limits to ordinary citizens. These days ¥40 or ¥60 will do. Allow yourself the best part of a day for exploration or several trips if you’re an enthusiast.There are official guides from ¥200 to ¥400 depending on how much you want to cover (inclusive for up to five people), but the automatically activated audio tours are cheaper (¥40; more than 40 languages) and more reliable. Restaurants, a cafe, toilets and even ATMs can be found within the palace grounds. Wheelchairs (¥500 deposit) are free to use, as are pushchairs/strollers (¥300 deposit).EntranceTourists must enter through the Meridian Gate, a massive U-shaped portal at the south end of the complex, which in former times was reserved for the use of the emperor. Gongs and bells would sound imperial comings and goings, while lesser mortals used lesser gates: the military used the west gate, civilians the east gate and servants the north gate. The emperor also reviewed his armies from here, passed judgement on prisoners, announced the new year’s calendar and oversaw the flogging of troublesome ministers. Up top is the Meridian Gate Gallery, which hosts temporary cultural exhibitions for both traditional Chinese arts and from abroad.Through the Meridian Gate, you enter an enormous courtyard, and cross the Golden Stream (金水; Jīn Shuǐ) – shaped to resemble a Tartar bow and spanned by five marble bridges – on your way to the magnificent Gate of Supreme Harmony. This courtyard could hold an imperial audience of 100,000 people. For an idea of the size of the restoration challenge, note how the crumbling courtyard stones are stuffed with dry weeds, especially on the periphery.First Side GalleriesBefore you pass through the Gate of Supreme Harmony to reach the Forbidden City’s star attractions, veer off to the east and west of the huge courtyard to visit the Calligraphy and Painting Gallery inside the Hall of Martial Valor and the particularly good Ceramics Gallery, housed inside the creaking Hall of Literary Glory.Three Great HallsRaised on a three-tier marble terrace with balustrades are the Three Great Halls, the glorious heart of the Forbidden City. The recently restored Hall of Supreme Harmony is the most important and largest structure in the Forbidden City. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, it was used for ceremonial occasions, such as the emperor’s birthday, the nomination of military leaders and coronations. Inside the Hall of Supreme Harmony is a richly decorated Dragon Throne (龙椅; Lóngyǐ), from which the emperor would preside over trembling officials. The entire court had to touch the floor nine times with their foreheads (the custom known as kowtowing) in the emperor’s presence. At the back of the throne is a carved Xumishan, the Buddhist paradise, signifying the throne’s supremacy.Behind the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the smaller Hall of Middle Harmony, which was used as the emperor’s transit lounge. Here he would make last-minute preparations, rehearse speeches and receive close ministers. On display are two Qing-dynasty sedan chairs, the emperor’s mode of transport around the Forbidden City. The last of the Qing emperors, Puyi, used a bicycle and altered a few features of the palace grounds to make it easier to get around.The third of the Great Halls is the Hall of Preserving Harmony, used for banquets and later for imperial examinations. The hall has no support pillars. To its rear is a 250-tonne marble imperial carriageway carved with dragons and clouds, which was transported into Běijīng on an ice path. The emperor used to be carried over this carriageway in his sedan chair as he ascended or descended the terrace. The outer housing surrounding the Three Great Halls was used for storing gold, silver, silks, carpets and other treasures.A string of side halls on the eastern and western flanks of the Three Great Halls usually, but not always, house a series of excellent exhibitions, ranging from scientific instruments and articles of daily use to objects presented to the emperor by visiting dignitaries. One contains an interesting diorama of the whole complex.Lesser Central HallsThe basic configuration of the Three Great Halls is echoed by the next group of buildings. Smaller in scale, these buildings were more important in terms of real power, which in China traditionally lies at the back door.The first structure is the Palace of Heavenly Purity, a residence of Ming and early Qing emperors, and later an audience hall for receiving foreign envoys and high officials.Immediately behind it is the Hall of Union, which contains a clepsydra – a water clock made in 1745 with five bronze vessels and a calibrated scale. There’s also a mechanical clock built in 1797 and a collection of imperial jade seals on display. The Palace of Earthly Tranquillity was the imperial couple’s bridal chamber and the centre of operations for the palace harem.Imperial GardenAt the northern end of the Forbidden City is the Imperial Garden, a classical Chinese garden with 7000 sq metres of fine landscaping, including rockeries, walkways, pavilions and ancient cypresses. Before you reach the Gate of Divine Prowess, the Forbidden City’s north exit, and Shùnzhēn Gate, which leads to it, note the pair of bronze elephants whose front knees bend in an anatomically impossible fashion, signifying the power of the emperor.Treasure GalleryIn the northeastern corner of the complex is a mini Forbidden City known as the Treasure Gallery, or Complete Palace of Peace and Longevity (宁寿全宫; Níng Shǒu Quán Gōng). During the Ming Dynasty, the Empress Dowager and the imperial concubines lived here. Today it comprises a number of atmospheric halls, pavilions, gardens and courtyard buildings that hold a collection of fine museums.The complex is entered from the south – not far from the Clock Exhibition Hall. Just inside the entrance, you’ll find the beautiful glazed Nine Dragon Screen, one of only three of its type left in China.Visitors then work their way north, exploring a number of peaceful halls and courtyards before being popped out at the northern end of the Forbidden City. Don’t miss the Pavilion of Cheerful Melodies, a three-storey wooden opera house, which was the palace’s largest theatre. Note the trap doors that allowed actors to make dramatic stage entrances.Western  Eastern PalacesA dozen smaller palace courtyards lie to the west and east of the three lesser central halls. It was in these smaller courtyard buildings that most of the emperors actually lived and many of the buildings, particularly those to the west, are decked out in imperial furniture. Those that are open to the public have cultural exhibitions displaying anything from temple musical instruments, to ceremonial bronze vessels and ceramics.	8.30am-5pm Apr-Oct, to 4.30pm Nov-Mar, last entry 1hr prior to closing, closed Mon	['8:30 - 15:30', '56:30 - 63:30', '80:30 - 87:30', '104:30 - 111:30', '128:30 - 135:30', '152:30 - 159:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/1262645.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.dpm.org.cn	True	True	150	admission Nov-Mar ¥40, Apr-Oct ¥60, Clock Exhibition Hall ¥10, Hall of Jewellery ¥10, audio tour ¥40	['Historic Site']	['Architectural Buildings', 'History Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	116.390660177	39.9182701894	6.5	4.5	['2638', '1683', '611', '125', '41']		No.4 Jingshanqian Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100009	False	9	150	[]
Chairman Mao Memorial Hall	china	beijing	activity	No doubt one of Běijīng's more surreal spectacles is the sight of Mao Zedong's embalmed corpse on public display within his mausoleum. The Soviet-inspired memorial hall was constructed soon after Mao died in September 1976, and is a prominent landmark in the middle of Tiān’ānmén Sq. He is still revered across much of China, as evidenced by the perpetual snaking queues of locals here clutching flowers to pay their respects; some are reduced to tears but most are in high spirits, treating it like any other stop along their Běijīng tour.	Mao's body lies in a crystal cabinet, draped in an anachronistic red flag emblazoned with hammer and sickle, as guards in white gloves impatiently wave visitors on towards further rooms where a riot of Mao kitsch – lighters, bracelets, statues, key rings, bottle openers, you name it – ensues. Directly outside the mausoleum are some stirring socialist realism war memorials that make for good photo ops.Mao is one of a pantheon of world communist/personality-of-cult leaders to be embalmed such as Vladimir Lenin, Ho Chi Minh and North Korea's Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-il, who are also on public display in their respective countries.Before you join the queue, all bags and cameras need to be deposited at the onsite building just east of Zhèngyáng Gate within Tiān’ānmén Sq towards Qianmen; collect it before 2pm. And don’t forget your passport. You won’t be let into the hall without it. Note, the queues may seem impossibly long, but they are constantly moving (visitors aren't allowed to stop inside the hall), so they go down relatively quickly.Be aware that opening hours can vary; occasionally it can open later at 9am or close earlier at 11am.	7am-noon Tue-Sun	['7:00 - 11:00', '55:00 - 59:00', '79:00 - 83:00', '103:00 - 107:00', '127:00 - 131:00', '151:00 - 155:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/178522674_medium.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	30	bag storage ¥10, electonics storage per device ¥10	['Mausoleum']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.391327824	39.9011518862	5.0	4.0	['27', '65', '30', '12', '6']	Tiān’ānmén Sq	Tiananmen Square, Dongcheng District, Beijing	False	71	30	[]
Jingshan Park	china	beijing	activity	The dominating feature of Jǐngshān – one of the city’s finest parks – is one of central Běijīng’s few hills; a mound that was created from the earth excavated to make the Forbidden City moat. Called Coal Hill by Westerners during Legation days, Jǐngshān also serves as a feng shui shield, protecting the palace from evil spirits – or dust storms – from the north. Clamber to the top for a magnificent panorama of the capital and princely views over the russet roofing of the Forbidden City.	On the eastern side of the park, a locust tree stands in the place where the last of the Ming emperors, Chongzhen, hanged himself as rebels swarmed at the city walls. The rest of the park is one of the best places in Běijīng for people-watching. Come early to see (or join in with) elderly folk going about their morning routines of dancing, singing, performing taichi or playing jiànzi, a traditional game of keepie-uppies played with an oversized shuttlecock. In April and May, the park bursts into bloom with fabulously colourful peonies and tulips forming the focal point of a very popular flower fair. The park has three gates: the south is directly opposite the Forbidden City's north gate (exit only), the west leads towards Běihǎi Park's east gate, while the east gate has a couple of nice cafes outside it.	6.30am-9pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/388ac67e6c0cac53d777eba962461aba1f6cf7850ba4dcb537dafd187cd88468/78962799427e2f3a1ba9a748d7ae7ba740eb6b400ebec62091bb3bfbe76739c5.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	30	adult/child ¥10/5	['Park']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	116.390548135	39.9230784754	6.5	4.5	['627', '407', '57', '2', '2']	Jingshan Qianjie	No.44 Jingshanxi Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100009	True	13	30	[]
National Museum of China	china	beijing	activity	Běijīng’s premier museum is housed in an immense 1950s communist-style building on the eastern side of Tiān’ānmén Sq, and is well worth visiting. The Ancient China exhibition on the basement floor is outstanding. You could easily spend a couple of hours in this exhibition alone. It contains dozens and dozens of stunning examples of ceramics, calligraphy jade and bronze pieces dating from prehistoric China through to the Qing Dynasty. It's all displayed beautifully in modern, spacious, low-lit exhibition halls. You'll need your passport to gain entry.	In this basement exhibition, look out for the 2000-year-old jade burial suit, made for the Western Han Dynasty king Liu Xiu, and the life-sized bronze acupuncture statue, dating from the 15th century. The 2000-year-old rhino-shaped bronze zūn (wine vessel) is another stand-out piece. The Ancient Chinese Money exhibition on the top floor, and the Bronze Art and Buddhist Sculpture galleries, one floor below, are also worth seeing.The ground floor has a number of Salvador Dalí sculptures, and a new room dedicated to socialist realism art with the epic Birth of New China ink painting, which depicts Mao Zedong addressing the nation to announce the establishment of People's Republic of China in 1949.The museum, which is vast and energy-sapping, also has a ground-floor cafe (sandwiches from ¥20) and a teahouse. There's a refreshing ban on selfie sticks.	9am-5pm Tue-Sun, last entry 4pm	['9:00 - 17:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00', '153:00 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/shutterstock_72787513.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://en.chnmuseum.cn	True	False	150	audio guide ¥30	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	116.395000644	39.9039510177	6.5	4.5	['176', '115', '48', '9', '6']	Guangchangdongce Lu, Tiān’ānmén Sq; 天安门，广场东侧路	No.16 East Chang'an Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100006	True	30	150	[]
Lama Temple	china	beijing	activity	This exceptional temple is a glittering attraction in Běijīng’s Buddhist firmament. If you only have time for one temple (the Temple of Heaven isn’t really a temple) make it this one, where riveting roofs, fabulous frescoes, magnificent decorative arches, tapestries, eye-popping carpentry, Tibetan prayer wheels, Tantric statues and a superb pair of Chinese lions mingle with dense clouds of incense.	The most renowned Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet, the Lama Temple was converted to a lamasery in 1744 after serving as the former residence of Emperor Yong Zheng. While the temple is an active place of worship, and you may occasionally see pilgrims prostrating themselves in submission at full length within its halls, the temple is mostly visited by tourists these days.Resplendent within the Hall of the Wheel of the Law (Fǎlún Diàn), the fourth hall you reach from the entrance, is a substantial bronze statue of a benign and smiling Tsong Khapa (1357–1419), founder of the Gelugpa or Yellow Hat sect, robed in yellow and illuminated by a skylight.The fifth hall, the Wànfú Pavilion (Wànfú Gé), houses a magnificent 18m-high statue of the Maitreya Buddha in his Tibetan form, clothed in yellow satin and reputedly sculpted from a single block of sandalwood. Each of the Bodhisattva’s toes is the size of a pillow. Behind the statue is the Vault of Avalokiteshvara, from where a diminutive and blue-faced statue of Guanyin peeks out. The Wànfú Pavilion is linked by an overhead walkway to the Yánsuí Pavilion (Yánsuí Gé), which encloses a huge lotus flower that revolves to reveal an effigy of the Longevity Buddha.Don’t miss the collection of bronze Tibetan Buddhist statues within the Jiètái Lóu, a small side hall. Most effigies date from the Qing dynasty, from languorous renditions of Green Tara and White Tara to exotic, Tantric pieces (such as Samvara) and figurines of the fierce-looking Mahakala. Also peruse the collection of Tibetan Buddhist ornaments within the Bānchán Lóu, another side hall, where an array of dorje (Tibetan sceptres), mandalas and Tantric figures are displayed along with an impressive selection of ceremonial robes in silk and satin.The street outside the temple entrance heaves with shops piled high with statues of Buddha, talismans, Buddhist charms, incense and keepsakes, picked over by a constant stream of pilgrims.	9am-4.30pm	['9:00 - 16:30', '33:00 - 40:30', '57:00 - 64:30', '81:00 - 88:30', '105:00 - 112:30', '129:00 - 136:30', '153:00 - 160:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/4d4d4cf48b76ff130d030bd71d681374e2109873d5893905508fb030aca348c2/9a244b6f3454f4c1ee4a2294625637108d763ae66c5e32b3b814c59de39b9abc.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.yonghegong.cn	True	False	90	admission ¥25, English audio guide ¥50	['Buddhist Temple']	['History Museums', 'Museums']	116.410811	39.944909	6.5	4.5	['829', '618', '142', '13', '4']	12 Yonghegong Dajie; 北新桥雍和宫大街12号	No.12 Yonghegong Street, Beixinqiao, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100007	True	12	90	[]
Bell Tower	china	beijing	activity	The modest, grey-stone structure of the Bell Tower is arguably more charming than its resplendent other half, the Drum Tower, after which this area of Běijīng is named. It also has the added advantage of being able to view its sister tower from a balcony.	Along with the drums in the Drum Tower, the bells in the Bell Tower were used as Běijīng’s official timekeepers throughout the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, and on until 1924. The Bell Tower looks the older of the two, perhaps because it isn’t painted. In fact both are of similar age. The Bell Tower was built during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, in 1272, and was rebuilt in the 1440s after being destroyed in a fire. This current structure was built in 1745.Like the Drum Tower, the Bell Tower can also be climbed up an incredibly steep inner staircase. But the views from the top are even better here, partly because the structure is set back more deeply into the surrounding hútòng, and partly because you can get great photos of the Drum Tower from its viewing balcony. Marvel, too, at the huge, 600-year-old, 63-tonne bell suspended in the pleasantly unrestored interior. Note how Chinese bells have no clappers but are instead struck with a stout pole.Inside the tower, on the ground floor (south side), is the Bell Tower Tea House, where you can sample a selection of Chinese teas as well as buy tea and tea sets.The Drum  Bell Sq, between the two towers, is a great people-watching area in which to while away some time even if you don’t climb either of the two towers. Both towers are lit up beautifully come evening.	9am-5pm, last tickets 4.40pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/b3e00116c18dabe89c518feead4501a3fcd9f66f8b8887636f15b9c23fe4015a/9f4b9ef99ddd87fbe86c2564873e2c5707a0a41b5684c34894014a42738584a3.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		True	False	30	admission ¥20, both towers through ticket ¥30	['Historic Site']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.389578544	39.9411023083	6.0	4.0	['99', '174', '78', '10', '0']	Gulou Dongdajie; 鼓楼东大街	Di'anmen Wai Main Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100006	True	37	30	[]

Southeast Corner Watchtower & Red Gate Gallery	china	beijing	activity	This splendid fortification, with a green-tiled, twin-eaved roof rising imperiously south of the Ancient Observatory, dates to the Ming dynasty. Mount the battlements for views alongside camera-wielding Chinese trainspotters eagerly awaiting rolling stock grinding in and out of Běijīng Train Station. Make sure to hunt out the signatures etched in the walls by allied forces during the Boxer Rebellion.	You can make out the name of a certain P Foot; ‘USA’ is also scrawled on the brickwork. The international composition of the eight-nation force that relieved Běijīng in 1900 is noted in names such as André, Stickel and what appears to be a name in Cyrillic. One brick records the date ‘Dec 16 1900’. Allied forces overwhelmed the redoubt after a lengthy engagement. Note the drainage channels poking out of the wall along its length. You can reach the watchtower from the west through the Railway Arch, which was built for the first railway that ran around Běijīng.The watchtower is punctured with 144 archers’ windows, as well as two forlorn stumps of flag abutments and a cannon or two. Attached to it is a 100m section of the original Inner City Wall, beyond which stretches the restored Ming City Wall extending all the way to Chongwenmen and north to Beijingzhan Dongjie. Inside the highly impressive interior is some staggering carpentry: huge red pillars that are topped with solid beams surge upwards. The 1st floor is the site of the Red Gate Gallery, one of Běijīng’s long-established modern art galleries. The 3rd-floor gallery has a fascinating photographic exhibition on the old gates of Běijīng, while the 4th-floor gallery contains more paintings. Say you are visiting the Red Gate Gallery and the ¥10 entry fee to the watchtower is normally waived.	8am-5.30pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/d9a3b1b34461d455b4ab539c78cb488713efd9633295f4d62feb53b6979b5294/d47efb3a08574e4915c5c9ddac95d852372ba78af9c85059aae02c99e502590b.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.redgategallery.com	False	False		¥10	['Watchtower', ' Gallery']	[]	116.428730064	39.9002966851			[]			False			[]

Fragrant Hills Park	china	beijing	activity	Easily within striking distance of the Summer Palace are Běijīng’s Western Hills (西山; Xī Shān), another former villa-resort of the emperors. The part of Xī Shān closest to Běijīng is known as Fragrant Hills Park. Beijingers flock here in autumn when the maple leaves saturate the hillsides in great splashes of red.	Scramble up the slopes to the top of Incense-Burner Peak (Xiānglú Fēng), or take the chairlift (one way/return ¥80/160, 9am to 4pm). From the peak you get an all-embracing view of the countryside, and you can leave the crowds behind by hiking further into the Western Hills.Near the north gate of Fragrant Hills Park, but still within the park, is the excellent Azure Clouds Temple, which dates back to the Yuán dynasty. The Mountain Gate Hall (Shānmén) contains two vast protective deities: Heng and Ha, beyond which is a small courtyard and the drum and bell towers, leading to a hall with a wonderful statue of Mílèfó – it’s bronze, but coal-black with age. Only his big toe shines from numerous inquisitive fingers.The Sun Yatsen Memorial Hall (Sūn Zhōngshān Jìniàn Tāng) contains a statue and a glass coffin donated by the USSR on the death of Mr Sun (the Republic of China's first president) in 1925. At the very back is the marble Vajra Throne Pagoda (Jīngāng Bǎozuò Tǎ), where Sun Yatsen was interred after he died, before his body was moved to its final resting place in Nánjīng. The Hall of Arhats (Luóhán Tāng) is well worth visiting; it contains 500 statues of luóhàn (those freed from the cycle of rebirth), each crafted with an individual personality.Southwest of the Azure Clouds Temple is the Tibetan-style Temple of Brilliance (Zhāo Miào), and not far away is a glazed-tile pagoda. Both survived visits by foreign troops intent on sacking the area in 1860, and then in 1900.There are dozens of restaurants and snack stalls on the approach road to the north gate of the park, making this your best bet for lunch out of any of the sights in this part of the city.At the time of writing it was expected that sometime in the future the subway will extend here via the Summer Palace and Botanic Gardens.	6am-6.30pm Apr-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Mar	[]			False	False	150	¥10 Apr-Oct, ¥5 Nov-Mar	['Park']	['Nature & Parks']	116.18550539	39.9872975804	5.0	4.0	['24', '37', '24', '5', '2']		Haidian District, Beijing	True	45	150	[]

Old Summer Palace	china	beijing	activity	Located northwest of the city centre, the Old Summer Palace was laid out in the 12th century. The ever-capable Jesuits were subsequently employed by Emperor Qianlong in the 18th century to fashion European-style palaces for the gardens, incorporating elaborate fountains and baroque statuary. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, British and French troops torched and looted the palace, an event forever inscribed in Chinese history books as a low point in China’s humiliation by foreign powers.	Most of the wooden palace buildings were burned down in the process and little remains, but the hardier Jesuit-designed European Palace buildings were made of stone, and a melancholic tangle of broken columns and marble chunks survives. Note: to see these remains, you need to buy the more expensive 'through ticket'.The subdued marble ruins of the Palace Buildings Scenic Area (Xīyánglóu Jǐngqū) can be mulled over in the Eternal Spring Garden (Chángchūn Yuán) in the northeast of the park, near the east gate. There were once more than 10 buildings here, designed by Giuseppe Castiglione and Michael Benoist. The buildings were only partially destroyed during the 1860 Anglo-French looting and the structures apparently remained usable for quite some time afterwards. However, the ruins were gradually picked over and carted away by local people all the way up to the 1970s.The Great Fountain Ruins (Dàshuǐfǎ) themselves are considered the best-preserved relics. Built in 1759, the main building was fronted by a lion-head fountain. Standing opposite is the Guānshuǐfǎ, five large stone screens embellished with European carvings of military flags, armour, swords and guns. The screens were discovered in the grounds of Peking University in the 1970s and later restored to their original positions. Just east of the Great Fountain Ruins stood a four-pillar archway, chunks of which remain.West of the Great Fountain Ruins are the vestiges of the Hǎiyàntáng Reservoir (Hǎiyàntáng Xùshuǐchí Táijī), where the water for the impressive fountains was stored in a tower and huge water-lifting devices were employed. The metal reservoir was commonly called the Tin Sea (Xīhǎi). Also known as the Water Clock, the Hǎiyàntáng, where 12 bronze human statues with animal heads jetted water for two hours in a 12-hour sequence, was constructed in 1759. The 12 animal heads from this apparatus ended up in collections abroad and Běijīng is attempting to retrieve them (four can now be seen at the Poly Art Museum). Just west of here is the Fāngwàiguàn, a building that was turned into a mosque for an imperial concubine. An artful reproduction of a former labyrinth called the Garden of Yellow Flowers is also nearby.The palace gardens cover a huge area – 2.5km from east to west – so be prepared for some walking. Besides the ruins, there’s the western section, the Perfection  Brightness Garden (Yuánmíng Yuán) and, in the southern compound, the 10,000 Springs Garden (Wànchūn Yuán).Bus 331 goes from the south gate (which is by Exit B of Yuanmingyuan subway station) to the east gate of the Summer Palace before continuing to the Botanic Gardens and eventually terminating at Fragrant Hills Park.	7am-6pm Apr-Oct, 7am-5.30pm Nov-Mar	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-125246204_high.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		False	False	150	adult ¥10, through ticket ¥25, map ¥6	['Historic Site']	['Ancient Ruins', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	116.3003058	39.99871641	5.0	4.0	['88', '73', '23', '4', '2']	28 Qinghua Xilu; 清华西路28号	Qinghuan West Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100007	True	28	150	[]
Beijing Botanic Gardens	china	beijing	activity	Exploding with blossom in spring, the well-tended Běijīng Botanic Gardens, set against the backdrop of the Western Hills and about 1km northeast of Fragrant Hills Park, makes for a pleasant outing among bamboo fronds, pines, orchids, lilacs and China’s most extensive botanic collection. Containing a rainforest house, the standout Běijīng Botanical Gardens Conservatory bursts with 3000 different varieties of plants.	About a 15-minute walk from the front gate (follow the signs), but still within the grounds of the gardens, is Sleeping Buddha Temple. The temple, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses a huge reclining effigy of Sakyamuni weighing 54 tonnes; it’s said to have ‘enslaved 7000 people’ in its casting. Sakyamuni is depicted on the cusp of death, before his entry into nirvana. On each side of Buddha are arrayed some sets of gargantuan shoes, gifts to Sakyamuni from various emperors in case he went for a stroll.On the eastern side of the gardens is the Cao Xueqin Memorial, where Cao Xueqin lived in his latter years. Cao (1715–63) is credited with penning the classic Dream of the Red Mansions, a vast and prolix family saga set in the Qing period. Making a small buzz in the west of the gardens is the little China Honey Bee Museum (中国蜜蜂博物馆; Zhōngguó Mìfēng Bówùguǎn), open 8.30am to 4.30pm March to October.	6am-8pm Apr-Oct, last entry 7pm, 7.30am-5pm Nov-Mar, last entry 4pm	['6:00 - 19:00', '30:00 - 43:00', '54:00 - 67:00', '78:00 - 91:00', '102:00 - 115:00', '126:00 - 139:00', '150:00 - 163:00']			False	False	90	adult ¥5, through ticket ¥50	['Gardens']	['Science Museums', 'Nature & Parks', 'Museums']	116.2034655	39.99760505	5.5	4.5	['22', '26', '7', '1', '1']		Wofosi Road,Xiangshan, Haidian District, Beijing, 100093	True	48		[]

Marco Polo Bridge	china	beijing	activity	Described by the great traveller himself, this 266m-long, multiarched granite bridge is the oldest bridge in Běijīng and is decorated beautifully with 485 individually carved stone lions, each one different. Dating from 1189, although widened in 1969, it spans the Yǒngdìng River, and was once the main route into the city from the southwest.	Despite the praises of Marco Polo, the bridge wouldn’t have have rated more than a footnote in Chinese history were it not for the famed Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which ignited a full-scale war with Japan. On 7 July 1937, Japanese troops illegally occupied a railway junction outside Wǎnpíng. Japanese and Chinese soldiers started shooting, and that gave Japan enough of an excuse to attack and occupy Běijīng.	7am-8pm Apr-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Mar	[]			False	False		¥20	['Bridge']	[]					[]			False			[]

Billed with the Great Wall as Běijīng’s winning double act, the imperial graveyard can be a dormant and lifeless spectacle, unless you pack a penchant for ceremonial tomb architecture or Ming imperial genealogy.	The Ming Tombs follow a standard imperial layout. In each tomb the plan consists of a main gate (líng mén), leading to the first of a series of courtyards and the main hall. Beyond this lie gates or archways leading to the Soul Tower (Míng Lóu), behind which rises the burial mound (tumulus). Three tombs have been opened to the public – Cháng Líng, Dìng Líng and Zhāo Líng. The road leading up to the tombs is a 7km stretch called the Spirit Way.

Zhengyang Gate	china	beijing	activity	The northernmost of Qiánmén's (前门) two gates is the 40m-high Zhèngyáng Gate. It dates from the Ming dynasty and was the largest of the nine gates of the Inner City Wall separating the inner, or Tartar (Manchu), city from the outer, or Chinese, city. Partially destroyed in the Boxer Rebellion around 1900, the gate was once flanked by two temples that have since vanished. With the disappearance of the city walls, the gate sits out of context, but it can be climbed for views and its museum.	Up top are decent views of Tiān’ānmén Sq and of Zhèngyáng Gate Arrow Tower, immediately to the south. Inside the upper levels are some fascinating historical photographs, showing the area as it was at the beginning of the last century, before the city walls and many of the surrounding gates and temples were demolished.

Wuta Temple	china	beijing	activity	The distinctive Wǔtǎ Temple (Five Pagoda Temple) is a hugely rewarding place to visit. That's not just because of its unusual architectural style – the temple is topped by its five attractive namesake pagodas and appears at first to owe more to Indian temple design than Chinese – but also because of the magnificent collection of stone carvings contained within its grounds.	Previously known as Zhēnjué Temple (真觉寺; Zhēnjué Sì), the exterior of the main hall is decorated with dorje, hundreds of images of Buddha and legions of beasts, amid traces of red pigment. During Ming times the temple ranged to at least six halls, all later tiled in yellow during Qing times; the terrace where the Big Treasure Hall once stood can still be seen. The temple, dating from 1473, is highly unusual for Běijīng, and well worth a visit in itself, but the highlight here is the extraordinary collection of stone carvings, some housed carefully in buildings at the back of the complex but many just scattered around the temple grounds. Pieces you might stumble across include gravestones, animal statues, carved human figures, stone stele and some enormous bìxì (mythical tortoise-like dragons often seen in Confucian temples). The pieces were all recovered from various places in Běijīng and put here for their protection during the latter end of the last century. Most are Qing and Ming dynasty, but there are a number of Yuan, Tang, Jin and even Eastern Han dynasty pieces, some of which are almost 2000 years old. Many, although not all, have explanatory captions in English; those captioned in Chinese only do at least have the date of origin written in numerals.On Wednesdays the first 200 visitors get in for free.

Great Bell Temple	china	beijing	activity	Newly refurbished, this famous shrine (originally called Juéshēng Temple) was once a pit stop for Qing emperors who came here to pray for rain. Today the temple is named after its massive Ming dynasty bell (6.75m tall and weighing a hefty 46.5 tonnes), which is inscribed with Buddhist sutras, comprising more than 227,000 Chinese characters, and decorated with Sanskrit incantations.	The bell was cast during the reign of Emperor Yongle in 1406, with the tower built in 1733. To transport the bell from the foundry to the temple, a shallow canal was dug, and when it froze over in winter the bell was shunted across the ice by sled. Nowadays, the bell is rung just once a year, on Lunar New Year's Eve.If you’re bell crazy, you’ll be spellbound by the exhibitions on bell casting, and the collection of bells from France, Russia, Japan, Korea and other nations. Also on view are copies of the bells and chimes of the Marquis of Zeng and a collection of Buddhist and Taoist bells, including vajra bells and the wind chimes hung from temple roofs and pagodas.	9am-4.30pm Tue-Sun	['8:24 - 16:33', '32:24 - 40:33', '56:24 - 64:33', '80:24 - 88:33', '104:24 - 112:33', '128:24 - 136:33', '152:24 - 160:33']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/354a4723b92e902fa0e1e06e27a68efe15320f4b9c4c8b1474666c3cbca266e2/42cb411682055e6edad7c450dad86585c96fb88b1e0e6f7b2f43d0213dba4673.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		False	False	120	¥20	['Buddhist Site']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	116.331975	39.966563	3.5	3.5	['1', '3', '0', '0', '1']	31a Beisanhuan Xilu; 北三环西路31a号	West Sanhuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100098	False	303		[]
Wanshou Temple	china	beijing	activity	Ringed by a red wall on the southeastern corner of Suzhou Jie (off the 3rd Ring Rd), the tranquil, little-visited Ming dynasty Wànshòu Temple, or Longevity Temple, was originally consecrated for the storage of Buddhist texts. Its name echoes the Summer Palace’s Longevity Hill (Wànshòu Shān), and the imperial entourage would stop here to quaff tea en route to and from the palace.	The temple was one of almost 50 that once lined the canal route from the western edge of the Imperial City walls (at Xīzhímén) to the Summer Palace. Now it is pretty much the only one that remains (Wǔtǎ Temple being another notable survivor). The temple fell into disrepair after the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, with the Wànshòu Hall burning down. Things went from bad to worse, and during the Cultural Revolution the temple served as an army barracks.There’s an interesting introduction to the history of the temple in the small hall (once the temple’s Drum Tower), immediately to your left as you enter the complex. And as you walk through the Hall of the Deva Kings, which leads to the second courtyard, notice the illustration on your right that shows all the temples that once lined the canal. The names are in Chinese only, but see if you can spot the temple you’re in (万寿寺) as well as neighbouring Yánqìng Temple (延庆寺; Yánqìng Sì), nearby Dragon King Temple (龙王庙; Lóngwáng Sì) and the magnificent Wǔtǎ Temple (marked on the map with its former name, 真觉寺), all of which still stand, at least in part.The highlight of a visit here, though, is to view the prized collection of bronze Buddhist statuary in the Buddhist Art Exhibition of Ming  Qing Dynasties, housed in two small halls on either side of the second courtyard. The displays guide you through the Buddhist pantheon with statues of Sakyamuni, Manjusri, Amitabha, Guanyin (in bronze and déhuà, or white-glazed porcelain) and exotic tantric pieces. Also look out for the kapala bowl made from a human skull, dorje and purbhas (Tibetan ritual daggers). Further halls contain museum exhibitions devoted to Ming and Qing porcelain and jade.Also worth checking out are the Buddhist stone and clay sculptures housed in the large unnamed central hall at the back of the second courtyard. There are four magnificent central pieces, plus a dozen or so arhats (Buddhist disciples) lining the flanks. The pavilion at the rear of the whole complex once housed a 5m-high gold-lacquered brass statue that's now long gone; in its place is a miniature Ming dynasty pagoda alloyed from gold, silver, zinc and lead.Note that on Wednesdays the first 200 visitors get in for free.As you exit the temple, see if you can track down the nearby remains of Yánqìng Temple and Dragon King Temple, further east along the canal. To walk from here to Wǔtǎ Temple takes around 20 minutes.	9am-4.30pm Tue-Sun	[]			False	False	90	adult ¥20	['Buddhist Temple']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.305121	39.944925	3.5	3.5	['3', '2', '2', '0', '0']	Xisanhuan Beilu; 西三环北路	Suzhou Street, Haidian District, Beijing, 100081	False	204		[]

Temple of Ancient Monarchs	china	beijing	activity	Constructed in 1530 as a twin of a temple built in Nánjīng in the 14th century, this rarely visited ancestral temple was reopened in 2004 after extensive renovations.

The scale of the complex is vast – the main hall, the massive Jing De Chong Sheng Palace is the second largest of its kind in Běijīng (after the Forbidden City's Hall of Supreme Harmony) – and although the atmosphere is somewhat lifeless, the architecture is impressive enough to warrant a quick side trip from your visit to nearby Miàoyīng Temple.

Ancient Observatory	china	beijing	activity	This unusual former observatory is mounted on the battlements of a watchtower lying along the line of the old Ming City Wall and originally dates back to Kublai Khan’s days, when it lay north of the present site. Kublai, like later Ming and Qing emperors, relied heavily on astrologers to plan military endeavours. The present observatory – the only surviving example of several constructed during the Jin, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties – was built between 1437 and 1446 to facilitate both astrological predictions and seafaring navigation.	At ground level is a pleasant courtyard flanked by halls housing displays (with limited English captions). Also within the courtyard is an armillary sphere dating to 1439, supported by four dragons.Clamber the steps to the roof of the watchtower to admire a mind-boggling array of Jesuit-designed astronomical instruments, embellished with sculptured bronze dragons and other Chinese flourishes – a kind of East and West astronomical fusion.	9am-5pm Tue-Sun, last entry 4.30pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/da78687c86db51acf23102c854070fef56f674f51dfecaae153e30161dd53cbe/828bcd29db24655fd9da5d0a343603221d7edd1182a45ad6eb6f467fc5eec68a.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		False	False	90	adult ¥20	['Observatory']	['Historic Sites', 'Observation Decks & Towers', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.428314181	39.9066799726	5.0	4.0	['6', '14', '10', '0', '0']	Jianguomen Bridge, East 2nd Ring Rd; 二环东路建国门桥; Erhuandong Lu, Jianguomen Qiao	No.2 Dongbiaobei Hutong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100005	True	139	90	[]
Dong'an Men Remains	china	beijing	activity	In two roadside pits, a couple of metres below the road surface on the north and south side of the crossroads here, are the remains of the once magnificent Dōng’ān Mén – the east gate of the Imperial City – as well as parts of the imperial city wall and parts of a bridge that used to cross the city canal (now a road).	The ruins are little more than small piles of bricks, but they are brought to life by a carved map fastened to one wall, showing what the area once looked like. Before being razed, the gate was a single-eaved, seven-bay-wide building with a hip-and-gable roof capped with yellow tiles.

St Joseph's Church	china	beijing	activity	A crowning edifice on Wangfujing Dajie, and one of Běijīng’s four principal churches, St Joseph’s is known locally as Dōng Táng (East Cathedral). Originally built during the reign of Shunzhi in 1655, it was damaged by an earthquake in 1720 and reconstructed. The luckless church also caught fire in 1807, was destroyed again in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion and restored in 1904, only to be shut in 1966. Now fully repaired, the church is a testament to the long history of Christianity in China.	A large piazza in front swarms with kids skate-boarding, newlyweds posing for photographs and elderly folk meeting up in the early evening for formation dancing.

Zhihua Temple	china	beijing	activity	Běijīng’s surviving temple brood has endured casual restoration that often buried authenticity. But this rickety nonactive temple, hidden down a rarely visited hútòng, is thick with the flavours of old Peking, having eluded the Dulux treatment that invariably precedes entrance fee inflation and stomping tour groups.	You won’t find the coffered ceiling of the Zhìhuà Hall (it’s in the USA), and the Four Heavenly Kings have vanished from Zhìhuà Gate (智化门; Zhìhuà Mén), but the Scriptures Hall, off to one side of the central courtyard, encases a unique, eight-sided, Ming-dynasty wooden library topped with a seated Buddha and a magnificently unrestored ceiling. The highlight, the Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall (Tathagata Hall  Wanfo Pavilion; 万佛殿; Wànfó Diàn), is right at the back of the complex, and is an enticing two floors of miniature niche-borne Buddhist effigies and cabinets for the storage of sutras. Its entrance is dominated by three stunning, wood-carved deities (a 20ft-tall Tathagata Buddha, flanked by Brahma and Indra). Unfortunately, visitors are no longer allowed to climb to the 2nd floor of this hall.Try to time your visit to coincide with the free, 15-minute, musical performance which takes place in Zhìhuà Hall at 10am and 3pm each day. Performers use traditional Chinese instruments associated with Buddhist worship.Note the surreal juxtaposition of this 15th-century temple with the swirling, space-age curves of the Galaxy Soho buildings, which now loom over this historic hútòng neighbourhood.	8.30am-4.30pm, closed Mon	['9:00 - 21:00', '33:00 - 45:00', '57:00 - 69:00', '81:00 - 93:00', '105:00 - 117:00', '129:00 - 141:00', '153:00 - 165:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/3106a337a3dbe9e56aedd6e6d13171377281512a8bfa447253a1604005cbc4f6/00b5f647902f7dd06b2fbe7f5a9b3cc15a3717fc42ef4b3a5a91e1e6eab674b1.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		False	False	90	adult ¥20, audio guide ¥10, Wed free	['Buddhist Temple']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.426057	39.915777	4.0	4.0	['4', '8', '0', '1', '0']	5 Lumicang Hutong; 禄米仓胡同5号	No.5 Lumicang Hu Tong, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100010	False	206		[]

Hall of Clocks & Watches	china	beijing	activity	The Clock Exhibition Hall is one of the unmissable highlights of the Forbidden City. Located in the Hall for Ancestral Worship (Fèngxiàn Diàn) – just off to the right after the Three Great Halls – the exhibition contains an astonishing array of elaborate timepieces, many of which were gifts to the Qing emperors from overseas. Many of the 18th-century examples are crafted by James Cox or Joseph Williamson (both of London) and imported through Guǎngdōng from England; others are from Switzerland, America and Japan.	Exquisitely wrought and fashioned with magnificently designed elephants and other creatures, they all display astonishing artfulness and attention to detail. Standout clocks include the ‘Gilt Copper Astronomy Clock’ equipped with a working model of the solar system, and the automaton-equipped ‘Gilt Copper Clock with a robot writing Chinese characters with a brush’.

Tanzhe Temple	china	beijing	activity	The largest of all Běijīng’s temples, and one of the oldest, 1700-year-old Tánzhè Temple dates from the Jin dynasty (AD 265–420), although it has been modified considerably since those days. It's attractively located amid trees in the mountains, and its ascending, terraced, temple grounds are overlooked by towering cypresses and pines, many of which are so old that their gangly limbs are supported by metal props. Visits around mid-April are recommended, as the magnolias are in bloom.	The temple itself clings to the base of a forested hill in a series of terraced courtyards and hallways, running along three connected axes; central, east and west. The central axis has the temple's main hall, the Mahavira Hall, behind which is a large courtyard, shaded by a 1000-year-old gingko tree, dubbed the Emperor Tree. Overlooking the courtyard (to the right) is a cute teahouse with seating on a wooden balcony. The Guanyin Pavilion at the back of the courtyard is the temple's highest point (with great views). The western axis includes two attractive octagonal altars, while the east contains the abbott's quarters, and was where visiting emperors would stay.There are cheap nóngjiāyuàn (农家院; village guesthouses) in the road leading up to Tánzhè Temple, offering rooms for ¥100. These often also serve meals for around ¥40.To get here, take the subway to Píngguǒyuán, then turn right out of exit D and catch the 931 bus (6am to 7.30pm, one hour, ¥5) from the first bus stop.	8am-5pm Apr-Oct, to 4.30pm Nov-Mar	[]			False	False	210	¥55	['Buddhist Temple']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']			4.5	4.5	['2', '2', '2', '1', '0']		Western Hills, 48km (30 miles) W of Beijing, Beijing	False	118	210	[]

Lu Xun Museum	china	beijing	activity	Lu Xun (1881–1936) is regarded as the father of modern Chinese literature. Born in Shàoxīng in Zhèjiāng province and buried in Shànghǎi, he lived in Běijīng for over a decade. As a writer, Lu Xun, who first trained in medicine, articulated a deep yearning for reform by mercilessly exposing the foibles of the Chinese character in such tales as Medicine and Diary of a Madman.

Fayuan Temple	china	beijing	activity	Infused with an air of reverence and devotion, this lovely temple dates back to the 7th century. The temple follows the typical Buddhist layout, with drum and bell towers. Do hunt out the unusual copper-cast Buddha, seated atop four further Buddhas ensconced on a huge bulb of myriad effigies in the Pilu Hall (the fourth hall).	Within the Guanyin Hall is a Ming-dynasty Thousand Hand and Thousand Eye Guanyin, while a huge supine Buddha reclines in the rear hall. Originally built to honour Tang-dynasty soldiers who had fallen during combat against the northern tribes, Fǎyuán is still a working temple, as well as home to the China Buddhism College, and you'll see plenty of monks about.

You can do a tasting upstairs of the firewater-like spirit, and pick up a souvenir bottle from its store for ¥15.

Mao Dun's Former Residence	china	beijing	activity	The lack of English captions is frustrating, but this small and unassuming museum does at least give visitors the chance to stroll around a trapped-in-time courtyard residence. Mao Dun was the pen name of Shen Yanbing (1896–1981), who was born into an elite family in Zhèjiāng province but educated in Běijīng. He lived at the back courtyard here from 1974 until his death.	In 1920, he helped found the Literary Study Society, an association promoting literary realism. Mao Dun joined the League of Left Wing Writers in 1930, becoming solidly entrenched in the bureaucracy after the communists came to power. He lay low during the Cultural Revolution, but briefly returned to writing in the 1970s. His best-known works are Spring Silkworms (1932) and Midnight (1934).

The life of Lao She – author of Rickshaw Boy and Tea House, and former teacher at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies – is detailed in a modest collection of halls, via newspaper cuttings, first-edition books, photographs and personal effects.

Bird's Nest	china	beijing	activity	The centerpiece from the 2008 Olympics is the National Stadium, known colloquially as the Bird’s Nest (鸟巢; Niǎocháo). It's one primarily for lovers of contemporary architecture, or those interested in sporting history. Otherwise walking around the desolate Olympic Sports Centre midweek is rather like being stuck in one of those zombie movies where humans have all but been wiped out. Nevertheless, it remains an iconic piece of architecture designed by Swiss firm Herzog  de Meuron in consultancy with controversial Běijīng-born artist Ai Wei Wei.	The basic entry ticket allows you to enter the stadium on the 1st and 5th floors, which has a few exhibition areas that were closed for repair in 2016. For a better view, you can pay ¥80 to climb up to its roof along the 'Air Corridor' walk.A few events are staged here, but it mostly stands empty and security staff and optimistic street vendors outnumber visitors.

Ming City Wall Ruins Park	china	beijing	activity	This slice of restored Ming Inner City Wall runs along the length of the northern flank of Chongwenmen Dongdajie and is attached to a slender strip of park. It's all that is left of the original 24km-long city wall, which started being demolished in the 1960s to make room for new roads and the subway system.	The wall stretches from the former site of Chóngwén Mén (崇文门; Chóngwén Gate), one of the nine gates of the Inner City Wall, to the Southeast Corner Watchtower and then turns north for a short distance along Jianguomen Nandajie to Beijingzhan Dongjie. Chóngwén Mén was also called Shuì Mén (税门; Tax Gate) as the capital tax bureau lay just outside the gate. You can walk the park’s length, taking in its higgledy-piggledy contours and the interior layers of stone in parts of the wall that have collapsed. The restored sections run for just over 2km, rising to a height of around 15m and interrupted every 80m with buttresses extending to a maximum depth of 39m. The most interesting sections of wall are those closer to their original and more dilapidated state and some of the bricks come complete with bullet holes.	24hr	['8:00 - 17:00', '32:00 - 41:00', '56:00 - 65:00', '80:00 - 89:00', '104:00 - 113:00', '128:00 - 137:00', '152:00 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/a9db2db1ffa8f705e647671622fee99bea332ce2fd1af905a285519e338a2160/f5c7f9c15242873e96b0f5437e241844afafaede5d82e078ff3504b922c46a5b.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop		False	False	90		['City Walls']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.420453271	39.8995993358	4.0	4.0	['7', '12', '3', '0', '0']	Chongwenmen Dongdajie; 崇文門东大街	No.9 Chongwenmen East Main Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing	False	142		[]

Dongyue Temple	china	beijing	activity	Dedicated to the Eastern Peak (Tài Shān) of China’s five Taoist mountains, the morbid Taoist shrine of Dōngyuè Temple is an unsettling, albeit fascinating, experience and one of the capital's most unique temples. An active place of worship tended by top-knotted Taoist monks, the temple's roots go all the way back to the Yuan dynasty. Its most notable for its long corridor exhibiting a series of comically macabre displays of statues representing different 'departments' from the Taoist underworld.	Before going in, note the temple’s fabulous Páifāng (memorial archway) lying to the south, divorced from its shrine by the intervention of the busy main road, Chaoyangmenwai Dajie.Stepping through the entrance pops you into a Taoist Hades, where tormented spirits reflect on their wrongdoing and elusive atonement. You can muse on life’s finalities in the Life and Death Department or the Final Indictment Department. Otherwise get spooked at the Department for Wandering Ghosts or the Department for Implementing 15 Kinds of Violent Death.It’s not all doom and gloom: the luckless can check in at the Department for Increasing Good Fortune and Longevity. Ornithologists will be birds of a feather with the Flying Birds Department, while the infirm can seek cures at the Deep-Rooted Disease Department. The Animal Department has colourful and lively fauna. English explanations detail department functions.Other halls are no less fascinating. The huge Dàiyuè Hall (Dàiyuè Diàn) is consecrated to the God of Tàishān, who manages the 18 layers of hell. Visit during festival time, especially during the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and you’ll see the temple at its most vibrant.Just outside the complex, in a small car park to the east, stands the handsome, but rather lonely Jiǔtiān Pǔhuā Gōng, a small temple hall which is the only remaining structure of two other Taoist temples that once also stood in this area. Built in 1647, the hall, which we think is now empty, once contained more than 70 clay and wooden statues dedicated to Léizǔ (雷祖), Taoism’s God of Thunder. Unfortunately, it's not open to the public.

CCTV Headquarters	china	beijing	activity	Shaped like an enormous pair of trousers, and known locally as Dà Kùchǎ (大裤衩), or Big Pants, the astonishing CCTV Tower is an architectural fantasy that appears to defy gravity. It's made possible by an unusual engineering design which creates a three-dimensional cranked loop, supported by an irregular grid on its surface. Designed by Rem Koolhaas and Ole Scheeren, the building is an audacious statement of modernity (despite its nickname) and a unique addition to the Běijīng skyline.	Unfortunately, there's no access to the site, unless you can score a visitors pass from someone who works there; the armed police who guard the gates lack a sense of humour. The strict security is partly a result of a February 2008 fire caused by stray fireworks from CCTV’s own Lantern Festival celebration, which sent the costly Television Cultural Center in the north of the complex up in flames. Despite burning for five hours with spectacular ferocity, none of this was shown on TV, with CCTV famously censoring its reporting of the huge conflagration (Běijīng netizens dryly noted how CCTV created one of the year’s biggest stories only to not cover it). The Běijīng Mandarin Oriental, a visitor’s centre and theatre were also destroyed in the blaze, but Big Pants itself escaped unsinged.

Great Hall of the People	china	beijing	activity	On the western side of Tiān’ānmén Sq, on a site previously occupied by Taichang Temple, the Jinyiwei (Ming-dynasty secret service) and the Ministry of Justice, the Great Hall of the People is the venue of the legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC). The 1959 Soviet-style architecture (which features on the ¥100 note) is monolithic and intimidating, and a fitting symbol of China’s huge bureaucracy. The ticket office is down the south side of the building; bags must be checked in but cameras are admitted.	Inside you can peek into 29 of its lifeless rooms named after the provinces of the Chinese universe. Also here is the banquet room where US president Richard Nixon dined in 1972, and the 10,000-seat auditorium with the communist red star embedded in a galaxy of ceiling lights – though you'll have to pay an extra ¥40 to get your photo taken in order to see the ceiling itself.	8.15am-4pm, times vary	[]			False	False	90	adult ¥30, bag deposit ¥2-5	['Notable Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Government Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	116.387271855	39.9035515147	5.0	4.0	['12', '14', '6', '3', '0']	Renda Huitang W Rd	West of Tian'anmen Square, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100017	True	80		[]
Zhongshan Park	china	beijing	activity	Named after Sun Zhongshan (Sun Yatsen), the father of modern China, this peaceful park sits at the southwest corner of the Forbidden City and partly looks out onto the palace’s moat (you can rent pedal-boats here) and towering walls. A refreshing prologue or conclusion to the magnificence of the Forbidden City, the park was formerly the sacred Ming-style Altar to the God of the Land and the God of Grain, aka Shèjìtán, where the emperor offered sacrifices. The Square Altar remains, bordered on all sides by walls tiled in various colours.	Near the park's south entrance stands a towering dark-blue-tiled páilou (traditional Chinese archway) with triple eaves that originally commemorated the German Foreign Minister Baron von Ketteler, killed by Boxers in 1900. Just off to the right (east) is the 100-year-old Láijīnyǔxuān Teahouse. North of here, also in the eastern section of the park, is the Forbidden City Concert Hall. As with Jǐngshān Park, April and May is a beautiful time to visit thanks to the hugely colourful Spring Flower and Tulips Show. The northeast exit of the park brings you out by Meridian Gate, from where you can enter the Forbidden City. The south exit brings you out near Tiān’ānmén Sq.

Treasure Gallery	china	beijing	activity	In the northeastern corner of the complex is the Treasure Gallery (or Complete Palace of Peace and Longevity; 宁寿全宫; Níng Shǒu Quán Gōng), a complex that architecturally resembles the Forbidden City in miniature. During the Ming Dynasty, the Empress Dowager and the imperial concubines lived here. Today it comprises a number of atmospheric halls, pavilions, gardens and courtyard buildings that hold a collection of fine museums.	Among the many exhibitions, highlights include the beautiful glazed Nine Dragon Screen, one of only three of its type left in China, and the Belvedere of Pleasant Sounds, a three-storey wooden opera house, which was the palace’s largest theatre.Enter the complex from the south – not far from the Clock Exhibition Hall; afterwards you'll be popped out at the northern end of the Forbidden City.

Hall of Supreme Harmony	china	beijing	activity	One of the Three Great Halls, this is the most important and largest structure in the Forbidden City. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, it was used for ceremonial occasions, such as the emperor’s birthday, coronations and the nomination of military leaders.	In its time, the Hall of Supreme Harmony was the tallest building in Běijīng as nothing was allowed to be built higher (although the Drum and Bell Towers were actually taller). It sits atop a three-tiered marble platform mimicking the Chinese character for king (王; wáng).Inside, the hall is a richly decorated Dragon Throne (龙椅; Lóngyǐ), from which the emperor would preside over trembling officials. The entire court had to touch the floor nine times with their foreheads (the custom known as kowtowing) in the emperor’s presence. At the back of the throne is a carved Xumishan, the Buddhist paradise, signifying the throne’s supremacy. Today you can only view it from the outside, and it is literally a rugby scrum to view it.

Confucius Temple & Imperial College	china	beijing	activity	An incense stick’s toss away from the Lama Temple, China’s second-largest Confucian temple has had a refit in recent years, but the almost otherworldly sense of detachment is seemingly impossible to shift. A mood of impassiveness reigns and the lack of worship reinforces a sensation that time has stood still. However, in its tranquillity and reserve, the temple can be a pleasant sanctuary from Běijīng’s often congested streets – a haven of peace and quiet.	Antediluvian bìxì (mythical tortoise-like dragons) glare from repainted pavilions while lumpy and ossified ancient cypresses claw stiffly at the Běijīng air. There's the Qianlong Stone Scriptures, a stone 'forest' of 190 stelae recording the 13 Confucian classics in 630,000 Chinese characters at the temple rear. Also inscribed on stelae are the names of successful candidates of the highest level of the official Confucian examination system.Next to the Confucius Temple, but within the same grounds, stands the Imperial College, where the emperor expounded the Confucian classics to an audience of thousands of kneeling students, professors and court officials – an annual rite. Built by the grandson of Kublai Khan in 1306, the former college was the supreme academy during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. On the site is a marvellous, glazed, three-gate, single-eaved decorative archway called a liúli páifāng (glazed archway). The Biyong Hall (辟雍大殿, Pìyōng Dàdiàn) beyond is a twin-roofed structure with yellow tiles surrounded by a moat and topped with a splendid gold knob. Its stupendous interior houses a vermillion and gold lectern. The side pavilions house several interesting museums on Confucianism and the academy itself.Some of Běijīng’s last remaining páilou (decorated archways) bravely survive in the tree-lined street outside (Guozijian Jie) and the entire area of hútòng here is now dotted with small cafes, cute restaurants and boutique shops, making it an ideal place to browse in low gear.

Wanping Old Town	china	beijing	activity	An astonishing sight, given that you are still within the confines of Běijīng’s 5th Ring Rd, this double-gated, Ming dynasty walled town is still lived in today. Although few of its original buildings still stand (residents live in newish brick bungalows these days), its 2km-long, 6m-high, battle-scarred town walls date from 1640.	You can’t walk on the walls, but you can walk around them or inside; enter via the West Gate, which is beside Marco Polo Bridge, or the East Gate, at the other end of the town’s only proper road. On the outside of the southern wall, you can see scars from the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in the form of huge bullet holes.

Despite being covered in gaudy grey, flaking paint, the cathedral is worth visiting, especially for those keen to glimpse the growing stature of Christianity in China.

Crescent Moon Muslim Restaurant	china	beijing	restaurant	You can find a Chinese Muslim restaurant on almost every street in Běijīng. Most are run by Huí Muslims, who are Hàn Chinese, rather than ethnic-minority Uighurs from the remote western province of Xīnjiāng. Crescent Moon is the real deal – owned and staffed by Uighurs, it attracts many Běijīng-based Uighurs and people from Central Asia, as well as a lot of Western expats.	It’s more expensive than most other Xīnjiāng restaurants in Běijīng, but the food is consistently good, and it has an English menu. The speciality is the barbecued leg of lamb (¥128). The lamb skewers (¥6) are also delicious, and there's naan bread (¥5), homemade yoghurt (¥12) and plenty of noodle options (¥18 to ¥25).

The location in the elegant former Legation Quarter is an added bonus, and there's an outside roof terrace for the summer.	Try the Dai-style roast pork in banana leaf (¥68), or one of the many splendid salads, such as the marinated beef salad and peppers or the Burmese tea leaves salad. But all the dishes on the extensive menu are enticing, and the service is attentive. The cocktails are another reason to stop by; the extortionately priced beer is its only downside.

Qianmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant	china	beijing	restaurant	This is the most popular branch of Běijīng’s most famous destination for duck – check out the photos of everyone from Fidel Castro to Zhang Yimou. The duck, while not the best in town, is roasted in ovens fired by fruit-tree wood, which means the birds have a unique fragrance, as well as being juicy, if slightly fatty.	It's very much geared to the tourist hordes (both domestic and foreign) and the crowds mean it is wise to reserve ahead.

Taste	china	beijing	restaurant	There's nothing outstanding about the food here, although it's tasty enough. But the heritage building and the roof terrace seating overlooking the shopping frenzy below make it stand out from the crowd on Nanluogu Xiang. The European-influenced two-storey building is unusual in these parts and dates from the early 1900s. You can eat inside the central building on either floor, or outside on the 1st-floor terrace.	The food is pan-Chinese, plus some questionable Chinese-Western combos, such as Peking duck pizza.

The first one you come to, if walking from Silver Ingot Bridge, is the main sit-down restaurant (look for the long, green-and-yellow sign). It has an English menu, including grilled skewers, lamb dishes and noodles, and is basic but clean. Further on is a smaller, older branch, which specialises in boiled tripe (爆肚; bàodǔ) and has an adjacent takeaway-dumplings stall, which is very popular at breakfast time: try the beef and onion dumplings (牛肉大葱包子; niúròu dàcōng bāozi; ¥2 each).

Then there's the array of authentic Uighur dishes from far-off Xīnjiāng, such as salted beef rolls with sweet yam (¥46), as well as a selection of Halal choices.	You'll need to order the roasted whole lamb in advance, but we think the roast lamb leg with spices is a bargain at ¥58.

Royal Icehouse	china	beijing	restaurant	Tucked away in the hútòng running alongside the east wall of Běihǎi Park, this intriguing restaurant is located inside one of the city's former royal ice houses – where, before the days of refrigeration, massive blocks of ice were stored for use in the imperial court during summer.	You can walk down into the underground ice cellars (which now keep the wine cool); look for the red arched door.The main restaurant is decked out in old-Běijīng paraphernalia; look for the homemade báijiǔ (sorghum liquor) hanging in pig's bladders. The food is imperial cuisine, but with a heavy Shāndōng influence (the original chef was from Shāndōng province), so there is some crossover in dishes. All are very well done, though. The menu is in English. To find the restaurant, walk south down Gongjian Hutong from Di'anmen Xidajie, turn right into 5 Gongjian Wuxiang and you'll see it straight ahead of you.	11.30am-2pm & 5.30-9.30pm	[]			False	False		mains ¥28-58	['Shandong']	[]	116.387089	39.928398			[]	5 Gongjian Wuxiang, Gongjian Hutong; 恭俭胡同5巷5号	Jianguomenwai Avenue, No. 1, Beijing	True			[]
Yuebin Fanguan	china	beijing	restaurant	Post-1949, this was the first privately owned restaurant to open in Běijīng. It's so minimalist that it still has an old canteen-like feel to it, but the focus here, as with many of China's best restaurants, is on the food, not the decor. This is a proper locals joint, so ignore the cigarette smoking and the fish-bone spitting, pull up a chair, order a bottle of Yanjing beer (燕京啤酒; Yānjīng píjiǔ), and tuck in.	The menu, naturally, is in Chinese only. House specialities include: guōshāo yā (锅烧鸭; fried duck – the first dish ever served here, apparently), suànní zhǒuzi (蒜泥肘子; pork shoulder in garlic and vinegar), miànjīn pá báicài (面筋扒白菜; glutinous braised cabbage), qīngchǎo xiārén (清炒虾仁; stir-fried shrimp) and wǔ sī tǒng (五丝筒; chicken-and-veg egg rolls, served with pancakes, leeks and hoisin sauce).

Grandma's	china	beijing	restaurant	Handy for shoppers on Wangfujing Dajie, but worth making the trip to from any part of the city, the Běijīng branch of this hugely successful Hángzhōu chain is a big hit in the capital. It's excellent value and is clean and bright, with comfy booth seating, so very popular with families. The menu is in English, although you might need a magnifying glass to read it.	Dishes we heartily recommend include Grandma's Pork (a juicy, braised pork dish, known in Hángzhōu as Dōngpō ròu; 东坡肉), tea-flavoured chicken (cooked with Hángzhōu's famous Lóngjǐng green tea), potatoes on a sizzling iron plate, the grilled eggplant and the organic cauliflour. But anything with a red thumbs-up icon next to it on the menu is a safe bet.This place is so popular you can expect to wait an hour on midweek evenings; two hours at weekends. Lunchtimes are less busy. You can't reserve in advance; you have to come to the entrance and take a ticket (like in a bank). As you do so, you need to enter your details on the touch screen. In the first box, enter your mobile telephone number. In the second box, enter the number of people there are in your group. Then click on the left-hand red button that reads: 领号 (meaning, receive a number), and take your ticket. Armed with your mobile number, the restaurant will then text you about five minutes before your table is ready. If you don't have a local phone, you'll have to keep coming back to check what number they're up to.	10am-2.30pm & 4-9pm	[]			False	False		mains ¥10-45	['H\xc3\xa1ngzh\xc5\x8du']	[]	116.405189	39.913909	5.5	4.5	[]	6th fl, Beijing apm shopping mall, 138 Wangfujing Dajie; 王府井大街138号apm6楼	Beijing apm 6F, No.138 Wangfujing Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing	True	32		[]

To find it, head east along Dongsi Batiao then turn left at the tiny hútòng crossroads and the unmarked restaurant will be on your left.

Dali Courtyard	china	beijing	restaurant	The charming hútòng setting in a restored courtyard makes this one of Běijīng’s more pleasant places to eat, especially in summer (in winter they cover the courtyard with an unattractive temporary roof).

Zhang Mama	china	beijing	restaurant	The original Zhāng Māma, on nearby Fensiting Hutong, was such a hit with Beijingers they were forced to also open this new, larger branch with two floors. At the smaller, original branch you have to wait up to an hour for a table. Here, they've cut that down to about 15 minutes. It's worth the wait. This is arguably Běijīng's best-value Sichuanese restaurant.  	The speciality is málà xiāngguō (麻辣香锅; ¥48 to ¥58), a fiery, chilli-laced broth with either chicken (香锅鸡; xiāngguō jī), prawns (香锅虾; xiāngguō xiā) or ribs (香锅排骨; xiāngguō páigǔ) simmering away inside, and with a variety of vegetables added into the mix. One pot is enough for two or three people. Also worth trying here is the dàndàn miàn (担担面; spicy dry noodles; ¥8) and the rice meals; the classic being the gōngbào jīdīng gàifàn (宫爆鸡丁盖饭; spicy chicken with peanuts; ¥12), which is lip-tinglingly delicious, thanks to the generous sprinkling of Sìchuān peppercorns.

It never closes, making it one of Běijīng’s most buzzing streets, and it’s especially fun on Friday and Saturday nights. Traffic slows to a crawl as the restaurant workers line the side of the road trying to entice passing cars to stop at their joint. Crowds of people spill out onto the pavement waiting for a free table while clacking open sunflower seeds, as the sweating staff rush around delivering food and beers to people celebrating the end of the week.Most styles of Chinese cuisine are represented on Ghost Street, but it’s best known for its hotpot and spicy seafood restaurants.The giant Xiǎo Yú Shān is always jammed with people cracking open crayfish and shrimp. For classic Běijīng-style hotpot, try Supreme Hotpot.Ghost Street gets its English name from a mistranslation for the Chinese nickname of the street, Gui Jie (簋街). 簋 (pronounced 'guǐ') is an ancient bronze food vessel, a statue of which you can find at the far eastern end of Dongzhimennei Dajie, by the 2nd Ring Rd, but it’s pronounced the same as 鬼 – Chinese for ghost.Sadly its signature red lanterns, which for years lined both sides of the street, lending it a unique look, were torn down by overzealous local officials in 2014 – they were a fire risk, apparently.

But the fish head with chopped chillis (¥78) and the ribs (¥128) are not be missed, while the dry pot dishes are also popular.

The Ritz-Carlton Beijing, Financial Street	china	beijing	hotel	A magnificent, modernist behemoth marooned amid the soulless towers of Běijīng’s financial district, the Ritz-Carlton remains one of the city’s finest hotels. Huge, comfy beds sit within luxurious and spacious rooms designed to cater for every whim of the traveller (we like the way you can charge your laptop inside the safe deposit box).	The acclaimed spa and health club occupies an entire floor, while there are Chinese and Western restaurants on site. Service is predictably excellent. Discounts of 40% available.

Raffles Beijing Hotel	china	beijing	hotel	Sandwiched between two drab edifices (to the east, the 1970s lines of the Běijīng Hotel, to the west a gawky Soviet-era facade), the seven-storey Raffles oozes cachet and grandeur. The heritage building dates to 1900 when it was the Grand Hotel de Pekin, and it stays true to its historic roots.	Illuminated in a chandelier glow, the elegant lobby yields to a graceful staircase leading to immaculate standard doubles that are spacious and well proportioned, decked out with period-style furniture and large bathrooms. The ground floor contains the hotel's most historic feature: the Writers Bar, once a common meeting place for Communist Party cadres, including Mao Zedong, and now a splendid spot for high tea (2.30pm to 5.30pm, one/two people ¥258/328) or a cocktail.

Beijing Downtown Backpackers	china	beijing	hotel	Downtown Backpackers is Nanluogu Xiang’s original youth hostel and it hasn’t forgotten its roots. Rooms are basic, therefore cheap, but are kept clean and tidy, and staff members are fully plugged in to the needs of Western travellers. Dorms have curtains for added privacy, along with power sockets and lamps. There's a rooftop terrace (complete with bench press and dumbbells) and a basement lounge to hang out in.	Rents bikes (per day ¥40) and runs recommended hiking trips to the Great Wall (¥280), plus a range of other city trips.

Old Beijing Square Hotel	china	beijing	hotel	This well reconstructed courtyard hotel has been done with taste and charm, with plenty of natural light seeping through the glass roof into the central courtyard. Rooms are small (bathrooms tiny) but furnished well, and staff are sweet. It's hidden down an unmarked alley off Baochao Hutong, next to a cheap hotel which doesn't accept foreigners.	There's free bike rental, complimentary coffee and tea, and an opportunity to practice your calligraphy.

Courtyard 7	china	beijing	hotel	Immaculate rooms, decorated in traditional Chinese furniture, face onto a series of different-sized, 400-year-old courtyards, which over the years have been home to government ministers, rich merchants and even an army general. Despite the historical narrative, rooms still come with modern comforts such as underfloor heating, wi-fi, and cable TV. Standard rooms are less atmospheric so upgrade to the superior rooms surrounding the courtyard.	The hútòng location – down a quiet alley, but very close to trendy Nanluogu Xiang – is also a winner.

Beijing Saga International Youth Hostel	china	beijing	hotel	Enjoying an interesting location on historic Shijia Hutong, this friendly, lively hostel is a grey block, but the inside compensates with some character and staff members are helpful towards travellers.

All rooms come with shared bathrooms. If you want private bathrooms, or if this place is full, ask to see its laid-back, but less charming sibling, Red Lantern House East Yard.
