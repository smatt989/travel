Luggage Store Gallery	usa	san-francisco	activity	Like a dandelion pushing through sidewalk cracks, this plucky nonprofit gallery has brought signs of life to one of the Tenderloin's toughest blocks for two decades. By giving SF street artists a gallery platform, the Luggage Store helped launch graffiti-art star Barry McGee, muralist Rigo and urban folklorist Clare Rojas. Find the graffitied door and climb to the 2nd-floor gallery, which rises above the street without losing sight of it.	Two Luggage Store regulars you might recognize around town are Rigo and Brazilian duo Ogemeos. Rigo did the 'One Tree' mural that looks like a one-way sign by the 101 Fwy on-ramp in SoMa. Ogemeos created the mural of a daredevil graffiti artist leaping off the side of the Luggage Store building. With such poignant streetwise works and regular community arts events, this place puts the tender in the Tenderloin.	noon-5pm Wed-Sat	['11:00 - 18:30', '35:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 67:30', '82:00 - 91:30', '106:00 - 115:30', '130:00 - 139:30', '154:00 - 163:30']		http://www.luggagestoregallery.org	True	False			['Gallery']	['Gift & Specialty Shops', 'Shopping']	-122.410408	37.781909	5.5	4.5	['4', '2', '0', '1', '0']	1007 Market St	506 Hayes St, San Francisco, 94102-4214	False	80		[]
Lombard Street	usa	san-francisco	activity	You’ve seen its eight switchbacks in a thousand photographs. The tourist board has dubbed this ‘the world’s crookedest street, ’ which is factually incorrect. Vermont St in Potrero Hill deserves that award, but Lombard is much more scenic, with its red-brick pavement and lovingly tended flowerbeds. It wasn’t always so bent; before the arrival of the automobile it lunged straight down the hill.	Don’t try anything funny here. The recent clampdown on renegade skaters means that the Lombard St thrills featured in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater video game will remain strictly virtual, at least until the cops get slack. Used to be that every Easter Sunday  in the early 2000s,  adults had arrived at the crest of Lombard St toting plastic toy tricycles for the annual Bring Your Own Big Wheel Race. But after vehement complaints from kill-joy residents, the art-prankster organizers moved their toy-joyride to – where else? – Vermont St. Now it's moved again.

Exploratorium	usa	san-francisco	activity	Is there a science to skateboarding? Do toilets really flush counterclockwise in Australia? Find answers to questions you wished you'd learned in school, at San Francisco's thrilling hands-on science museum. Combining science with art, and investigating human perception, the Exploratorium nudges you to question how you perceive the world around you. The setting is thrilling – a nine-acre, glass-walled pier jutting straight into San Francisco Bay, with large outdoor portions you can explore free of charge, twenty-four hours a day.	Covering a whopping 330,000 sq feet of indoor-outdoor space, galleries focus on color, sound, light and motion, stimulating learning by inviting participation. Never didactic, always engaging, the over-600 exhibits have buttons to push, cranks to ratchet, and dials to adjust, all   tinkered together by artists and scientists at the in-house building shop (which you can  peer into). Try on a  punk hairdo, courtesy of the static-electricity station. Turn your body into the gnomon of a sun-dial. Slide, climb and feel your way – in total darkness – through the labyrinth of the thrilling Tactile Dome (reservations and separate ticket required). Frank Oppenheimer founded the Exploratorium in 1969. He'd been a physicist on the atom bomb, was blackballed during the McCarthy era, then later reemerged as a high-school teacher, eschewing secret scientific study in favor of public education. The Exploratorium is his lasting legacy, with the mission to incorporate technology with human values. In 2013 the Exploratorium moved from the Marina to Pier 15, a brand-new purpose-built solar-powered space, constructed in concert with scientific agencies, including NOAA, which hard-wired the entire pier with sensors delivering real-time data on weather, wind, tides, and the bay. See the data flow in at your final stop, the Observatory Gallery, a glass-enclosed lookout where you can make your own observations about sea, land and sky.     	10am-5pm Tue-Sun, over 18yr only Thu 6-10pm	['10:00 - 17:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00', '114:00 - 118:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/184795465_full.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.exploratorium.edu	True	False	150	adult/child $29/19, 6-10pm Thu $15	['Museum']	["Children's Museums", 'Science Museums', 'Museums']	-122.398177	37.801146	6.5	4.5	['1376', '412', '108', '22', '5']	Pier 15	Pier 15, on the Embarcadero, San Francisco, 94111	True	9	150	[]

Flashbacks are a given in the Haight, which still has its swinging ’60s tendencies. Only a very mysterious, very local illness could explain the number of neighborhood medical marijuana clubs, and tie-dyes and ideals have never entirely gone out of fashion here – hence the highly prized vintage psychedelic rock tees on the wall at Wasteland and urban farming manuals in their umpteenth printing at Bound Together Anarchist Book Collective.

Balmy Alley	usa	san-francisco	activity	Inspired by Diego Rivera's 1930s San Francisco murals and outraged by US foreign policy in Central America, 1970s Mission muralistas (muralists) set out to transform the political landscape, one mural-covered garage door at a time. Today, Balmy Alley murals span three decades, from an early memorial for El Salvador activist Archbishop Óscar Romero to an homage to Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe and other trailblazing women modern artists.	The earliest works in Balmy Alley by Mujeres Muralistas (Women Muralists) and Placa ('mark-making') transformed back-alley fences into a united artistic front. Now nonprofit Precita Eyes restores these murals, commissions new ones by San Francisco artists and runs muralist-led tours that cover more than 50 Mission murals within an eight-block radius of Balmy Alley.

Golden Gate Bridge	usa	san-francisco	activity	San Franciscans have passionate perspectives on every subject, especially their signature landmark, though everyone agrees that it's a good thing that the navy didn't get its way over the bridge's design – naval officials preferred a hulking concrete span, painted with caution-yellow stripes, over the soaring art-deco design of architects Gertrude and Irving Murrow and engineer Joseph B Strauss, which, luckily, won the day.	As far as best views go, cinema buffs believe Hitchcock had it right: seen from below at Fort Point, the 1937 bridge induces a thrilling case of Vertigo. Fog aficionados prefer the north-end lookout at Marin’s Vista Point, to watch gusts billow through bridge cables like dry ice at a Kiss concert.To see both sides of the Golden Gate debate, hike or bike the 1.7-mile span. MUNI bus 28 runs to the parking lot, and pedestrians and cyclists can cross the bridge on sidewalks. For drivers, bridge tolls are billed electronically to your vehicle's license plate; for details, see www.goldengate.org/tolls.

Alcatraz	usa	san-francisco	activity	Alcatraz: for over 150 years, the name has given the innocent chills and the guilty cold sweats. Over the decades, it’s been the nation’s first military prison, a forbidding maximum-security penitentiary and disputed territory between Native American activists and the FBI. No wonder that first step you take onto ‘the Rock’ seems to cue ominous music: dunh-dunh-dunnnnh!	It all started innocently enough back in 1775, when Spanish lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala sailed the San Carlos past the 22-acre island he called Isla de Alcatraces (Isle of the Pelicans). In 1859 a new post on Alcatraz became the first US West Coast fort, and soon proved handy as a holding pen for Civil War deserters, insubordinates and those who had been court-martialed. Among the prisoners were Native American scouts and ‘unfriendlies,’ including 19 Hopis who refused to send their children to government boarding schools where speaking Hopi and practicing their religion were punishable by beatings. By 1902 the four cell blocks of wooden cages were rotting, unsanitary and otherwise ill-equipped for the influx of US soldiers convicted of war crimes in the Philippines. The army began building a new concrete military prison in 1909, but upkeep was expensive and the US soon had other things to worry about: WWI, financial ruin and flappers.When the 18th Amendment to the Constitution declared selling liquor a crime in 1922, rebellious Jazz Agers weren’t prepared to give up their tipple – and gangsters kept the booze coming. Authorities were determined to make a public example of criminal ringleaders, and in 1934 the Federal Bureau of Prisons took over Alcatraz as a prominent showcase for its crime-fighting efforts. ‘The Rock’ averaged only 264 inmates, but its roster read like an America’s Most Wanted list. A-list criminals doing time on Alcatraz included Chicago crime boss Al ‘Scarface’ Capone, dapper kidnapper George ‘Machine Gun’ Kelly, hot-headed Harlem mafioso and sometime poet ‘Bumpy’ Johnson, and Morton Sobell, the military contractor found guilty of Soviet espionage along with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.Today, first-person accounts of daily life in the Alcatraz lockup are included on the award-winning audio tour provided by Alcatraz Cruises. But take your headphones off for just a moment, and notice the sound of carefree city life traveling across the water: this is the torment that made perilous escapes into rip tides worth the risk. Though Alcatraz was considered escape-proof, in 1962 the Anglin brothers and Frank Morris floated away on a makeshift raft and were never seen again. Security and upkeep proved prohibitively expensive, and finally the island prison was abandoned to the birds in 1963.Native Americans claimed sovereignty over the island in the ’60s, noting that Alcatraz had long been used by the Ohlone as a spiritual retreat, yet federal authorities refused their proposal to turn Alcatraz into a Native American study center. Then on the eve of Thanksgiving 1969, 79 Native American activists swam to the island and took it over. During the next 19 months, some 5600 Native Americans would visit the occupied island. Public support eventually pressured President Richard Nixon to restore Native territory and strengthen self-rule for Native nations in 1970. Each Thanksgiving Day since 1975, an ‘Un-Thanksgiving’ ceremony has been held at dawn on Alcatraz, with Native leaders and supporters showing their determination to reverse the course of colonial history. After the government regained control of the island, it became a national park, and by 1973 had already become a major draw. Today the cell blocks, ‘This Is Indian Land’ water-tower graffiti and rare wildlife are all part of the attraction.	call center 8am-7pm, ferries depart Pier 33 half-hourly 8:45am-3:50pm, night tours 5:55pm & 6:30pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/shutterstock_239675278.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.nps.gov/alcatraz	True	True	150	day tours adult/child/family $33/21/100, night tours adult/child $40/24	['Historic Site']	['Historic Sites', 'Islands', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	-122.422932344	37.8267848359	6.5	4.5	['20988', '5614', '830', '146', '135']		Pier 33, San Francisco, 94122	False	1	150	[]

Two key attractions remain: sea lions barking on Seal Rock and the Camera Obscura, a vintage 1946 attraction projecting outdoor sea views onto a parabolic screen. 	After an 1894 fire destroyed the original structure, Sutro rebuilt the Cliff House as a palatial eight-story Victorian resort with art galleries, dining rooms and an observation tower. It miraculously survived the 1906 earthquake, only to be destroyed by fire the following year. The 1909 stark neoclassical replacement built by Sutro's daughter Emma remained popular for its saloon and restaurant.

Sutro Baths	usa	san-francisco	activity	Hard to imagine from these ruins, but Victorian dandies and working stiffs once converged here for bracing baths in itchy wool rental swimsuits. Millionaire Adolph Sutro built hot and cold indoor pools to accommodate 10,000 unwashed masses in 1896, but the masses apparently preferred dirt – despite added attractions including trapezes and Egyptian mummies, the baths went bust in 1952. At low tide, follow the steep path past the now-ruined baths and through the sea-cave tunnel to find sublime Pacific panoramas.	These splendid ruins made a fitting backdrop for 1971's May–December comedy classic Harold  Maude, and recently set the scene for theatrical performances by the Bay Area's We Players (www.weplayers.org). Above the baths are the new Land's End Lookout visitor center and café plus the Sutro Heights Park public gardens, built in 1885 and restored with native plants.	sunrise-sunset; visitor center 9am-5pm	[]		http://www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/sutro-baths.htm	False	False	90		['Park']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-122.513512	37.780331	5.5	4.5	['126', '74', '25', '5', '0']	680 Point Lobos Ave	Point Lobos, San Francisco	True	66		[]

City Hall	usa	san-francisco	activity	Rising from the ashes of the 1906 earthquake, this beaux arts landmark echoes with history. Singing protesters determined to end red-scare McCarthy hearings were blasted with firehoses here in 1960 – yet America's first sit-in worked. America's first openly gay official Supervisor Harvey Milk was assassinated here in 1978, along with Mayor George Moscone – but in 2004, 4037 same-sex couples were legally wed here for the first time. Lately City Hall has approved pioneering green initiatives, making SF the nation's environmental leader.	The dome's gilded exterior is a cringe-worthy reminder of 1990s dot-com excess, when the city squandered a short-lived windfall on gold leafing – but at least its foundations are solid now. Designed in 1915 to outdo Paris for flair and outsize the capitol in Washington, DC, the world's fifth-largest dome was unsteady until its retrofit after the 1989 earthquake, when ingenious technology enabled it to swing on its base without raising alarm. Don't miss public art exhibitions, which range from portraits of iconic LGBT performers to photographs of fog banks hovering inside San Francisco buildings.Free docent-led tours meet at the tour kiosk near the Van Ness Ave entrance, but City Hall is best seen in action.

Swedenborgian Church	usa	san-francisco	activity	Radical ideals in the form of distinctive buildings make beloved SF landmarks; this standout 1894 example is the collaborative effort of 19th-century Bay Area progressive thinkers, such as naturalist John Muir, California Arts and Crafts leader Bernard Maybeck and architect Arthur Page Brown.  Inside, nature is everywhere – in hewn-maple chairs, mighty madrone trees supporting the roof and in scenes of Northern California that took muralist William Keith 40 years to complete. 	Church founder Emanuel Swedenborg was an 18th-century Swedish theologian, scientist and occasional conversationalist with angels; he believed  humans are spirits in a material world unified by nature, love and luminous intelligence – a lovely concept, embodied in an equally lovely building.

Transamerica Pyramid & Redwood Park	usa	san-francisco	activity	The defining feature of San Francisco's skyline is this 1972 pyramid, built atop the wreck of a whaling ship abandoned in the Gold Rush. A half-acre redwood grove sprouted out front, on the site of Mark Twain's favorite saloon and the newspaper office where Sun Yat-sen drafted his Proclamation of the Republic of China. Although these transplanted redwoods have shallow roots, their intertwined root network allows them to reach dizzying heights. Mark Twain couldn't have scripted a more perfect metaphor for San Francisco.	Architect William Pereira's triangular structure allows light to reach the trees and narrow streets beneath the Pyramid. But at first, critics claimed Pereira's Hollywood special-effects background was too obvious in his 853ft rocket-ship design.

Old St Mary's Cathedral & Square	usa	san-francisco	activity	California's first cathedral was started in 1854 by an Irish entrepreneur determined to give wayward San Francisco some religion – despite its location on brothel-lined Dupont St. The 1906 earthquake miraculously spared the church's brick walls but destroyed a bordello across the street, making room for St Mary's Square. Today, skateboarders do tricks of a different sort in the park, under the watchful eye of Beniamino Bufano's 1929 pink-granite-and-steel statue of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yatsen.	Eventually the archdiocese abandoned attempts to convert Dupont St and handed the church over to America's first Chinese community mission, run by the activism-oriented Paulists.

Masonic Auditorium and Temple	usa	san-francisco	activity	Conspiracy theorists, rock aficionados and anyone exploring immigrant roots must know the Masonic Auditorium.

Peak inside the lobby to see the window mosaics. The on-site museum focuses on California's Masonic history.	If you're looking for confirmation that California is run by a secret club, here you have it: many of the nation's founding fathers were Freemasons, including George Washington, and the same can be said about California's. It's all captured in the modernist stained-glass windows, which depict founders of freemasonry in California and their accomplishments – if you can decipher the enigmatic symbols and snippets of fabric embedded in the glass. The frieze below the windows has soil and gravel samples from all 58 California counties, plus Hawaii for some reason known only to those in on the secret handshake.

Diego Rivera's Allegory of California Fresco	usa	san-francisco	activity	Hidden in a downtown skyscraper is a San Francisco art treasure: Diego Rivera's 1930–31 Allegory of California fresco. Take the elevator to the 10th floor and walk upstairs to see Rivera's depiction of California as a golden goddess offering farm-fresh produce, while beneath her gold miners toil and oil refineries loom large on the horizon. Rivera's fresco is glorious, but cautionary – while Californian workers, inventors and dreamers go about their business, the pressure gauge in the left-hand corner is entering the red zone.  	Today it might seem strange that architect Timothy Pflueger would invite such an outspoken critic of capitalism as Diego Rivera to paint the mural gracing the entry to San Francisco's Stock Exchange Lunch Club (now the City Club) – but after the 1929 US stock market crash, Rivera wasn't the only skeptic of unregulated markets. The Allegory of California was his first US fresco commission, and it would be a couple years yet before his Rockefeller Center mural in New York would be denounced as communist and scrapped. Instead, Rivera and his young bride Frida Kahlo were the toast of the town in San Francisco, and started a mural movement that continues here today.  	mural access 3-5pm Mon-Fri	[]			False	False	90		['Public Art']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-122.401021	37.791592	5.0	5.0	['11', '1', '0', '0', '0']	155 Sansome St	City College of San Francisco, Diego Rivera Theater, San Francisco, 94112	False	217		[]

Mission Dolores	usa	san-francisco	activity	The city's oldest building and its namesake, whitewashed adobe Misión San Francisco de Asís was founded in 1776 and rebuilt starting in 1782 with conscripted Ohlone and Miwok labor – a graveyard memorial hut commemorates 5000 Ohlone and Miwok laborers who died in mission measles epidemics in the early 19th century. Today the modest adobe mission is overshadowed by the ornate adjoining 1913 basilica, featuring stained-glass windows of California's 21 missions.	The building's nickname, Mission Dolores (Mission of the Sorrows), was taken from a nearby lake – but it turned out to be tragically apt for native conscripts exposed to harsh living conditions and little resistance to introduced diseases. Their work survives them in the original adobe mission. The ceiling is patterned after Native baskets, and recent restorations revealed a hidden Ohlone mural behind the altar of a sacred heart, pierced by a sword and dripping with blood.Surrounding the Ohlone memorial in the mission graveyard, you'll notice graves dating from the Gold Rush. Alongside mission founders are buried Don Luis Antonio Arguello, the first governor of Alta California under Mexican rule, and Don Francisco de Haro, the first mayor of San Francisco. Hitchcock fans looking for the grave of Carlotta Valdes will be disappointed: the tomb was only a prop for the film Vertigo.Next door to the modest adobe mission is a grand churrigueresque basilica, built after an 1876 brick Gothic cathedral collapsed in the 1906 earthquake. The front doors are usually only open during services, so you'll need to pass through the original adobe mission structure and cross a courtyard to enter the basilica's side door.Your eyes may take a moment to adjust once you're inside, because most of the light is filtered through the basilica's splendid stained-glass windows. The choir windows show St Francis beaming beatifically against an orange background. Lower windows along the nave feature 21 California missions from Sonoma to San Diego, plus mission builders Father Junípero Serra and Father Francisco Palou. True to Mission Dolores' name, seven panels depict the Seven Sorrows of Mary: one above the main door and three on each of the side balconies.	9am-4pm Nov-Apr, to 4:30pm May-Oct	['9:00 - 16:00', '33:00 - 40:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']		http://www.missiondolores.org	False	False	90	adult/child $5/3	['Church']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-122.426853	37.76445	5.5	4.5	['71', '68', '16', '0', '1']	3321 16th St	3321 16th St, San Francisco, 94114-1712	True	86		[]

After 92 changes to satisfy censors, Refregier finally concluded the mural cycle in 1948 with War  Peace, pointedly contrasting scenes of Nazi book-burning and post-war promises of 'freedom from fear/want/of worship/speech.'	Initially denounced as ‘communist’ by McCarthyists, Refregier's masterpiece is now protected as a National Landmark.

Dolores Park	usa	san-francisco	activity	Semiprofessional tanning, taco picnics and a Hunky Jesus Contest at Easter: welcome to San Francisco's sunny side. Dolores Park has something for everyone, from street ball and tennis to the Mayan pyramid playground (sorry kids: no blood sacrifice allowed). Political protests and other favorite local sports happen year-round, and there are free movie nights and Mime Troupe performances in summer. Climb to the upper southwest corner for the best views of downtown, framed by palm trees. 	Dolores Park was built on the site of a former Jewish cemetery used as a staging ground by Barnum and Bailey Circus, sold to the city in 1905. San Francisco's 1906 earthquake and fire violently interrupted park planning, and it remained bumpy, squishy and poorly drained until its 2015 regrading. At the corner of 20th and Church, note the fire hydrant painted gold: this little fireplug was the Mission's main water source during the 1906 earthquake and fire, and stopped the fire from spreading south of 20th St. Flat patches further down are generally reserved for soccer games, cultural festivals, candlelight vigils and ultimate Frisbee.

Pier 39	usa	san-francisco	activity	The focal point of Fisherman's Wharf isn't the waning fishing fleet, but the carousel, carnival-like attractions, shops and restaurants of Pier 39 – and, of course, the famous sea lions. Developed in the 1970s to revitalize tourism, the pier draws thousands of tourists daily, but it's really just a big outdoor shopping mall. On the plus side, its visitors center rents strollers, stores luggage, and has free phone-charging stations.  	The sea lions took over this coveted waterfront real estate in 1989 and these unkempt squatters have been making a public display ever since – canoodling, belching, scratching their backsides and gleefully shoving one another off the docks – becoming San Francisco's favorite mascots. And because California law requires boats to make way for marine mammals, yacht owners have had to relinquish valuable slips to accommodate the as many as 1300 sea lions that 'haul out' onto the docks between January and July.

This bare-breasted deity is modeled after Big Alma Spreckles, who volunteered her nude-modeling services when she heard sugar-baron Adolph Spreckels was heading the monument committee.

Palace Hotel	usa	san-francisco	activity	A true San Francisco survivor, the Palace opened in 1875, but was gutted during the 1906 earthquake. Opera star Enrico Caruso was jolted from his Palace bed by the quake and fled town, never to return to San Francisco. But the Palace reopened by 1909, and Woodrow Wilson gave his League of Nations speech here 10 years later. Visit by day to see the Garden Court stained-glass ceiling, then peek into Pied Piper Bar to see Maxfield Parrish's Pied Piper mural.	Recently Palace management removed the Parrish mural with the intention of auctioning it off – but San Franciscans rallied, and insisted on the Piper's return to his rightful place. Toast San Franciscan resilience under the Pied Piper, and if you're feeling brave, head to the House of Shields for another at the opulent mahogany back bar. This ornate bar was originally intended to frame Parrish's mural, but maybe the woodworker had one too many – it was too small to fit the Pied Piper..

Bohemian Club	usa	san-francisco	activity	San Francisco's most infamous, secretive men's club was originally founded by bonafide bohemians – but they couldn't afford the upkeep, so they allowed the ultra-rich to join. Today's member roster lists an odd mix of power elite and artists: apparently both George W Bush and Greatful Dead frontman Bob Weir are current members. On the Post St side of the ivy-covered club, look for the plaque honoring Gold Rush–era author Bret Harte, which depicts characters from his works.	On the plaque's extreme right is 'The Heathen Chinee.' It's not a racist attack, but a reference to the eponymous 1870 satirical poem Harte wrote mocking anti-Chinese sentiment in Northern California. Ironically, the poem had the opposite effect, and became a rallying cry against Chinese immigration.		[]			False	False			['Historic Building']	[]	-122.411578	37.788022			[]	624 Taylor St		False			[]

The upscale oyster bar overlooking a gritty street corner is a definite clunker, but the Four Barrell coffee kiosk, multi-culti food stalls and central wine bar are hits with techie lunch crowds.

Bob Kaufman Alley	usa	san-francisco	activity	What, you mean your hometown doesn’t have a street named after an African American Catholic-Jewish-voodoo anarchist street poet? The Beat poet revered in France as the ‘American Rimbaud’ co-founded legendary Beatitudes magazine in 1959, and was a spoken-word jazz artist never at a loss for words. Yet he felt compelled to take a Buddhist vow of silence after John F Kennedy’s assassination that he kept until the Vietnam War ended - 12 years later. The hidden alleyway honoring him is offbeat, streetwise, and often profoundly silent. 	Kaufman’s life was hardly pure poetry: he was a teenage runaway, periodically found himself homeless, was occasionally jailed for picking fights in poetry with police, battled methamphetamine addiction with varying success and once claimed his goal was to be forgotten. This alley may be thwarting that goal - but so did Bob Kaufman's own troubled genius.		[]			False	False			['Street']	[]	-122.407219	37.801408			[]			False			[]

Chinese Telephone Exchange	usa	san-francisco	activity	California's earliest adopters of advanced technology weren't Silicon Valley programmers but Chinatown switchboard operators. This triple-decker tiled pagoda revolutionized communication in 1894. To connect callers, switchboard operators spoke fluent English and five Chinese dialects and memorized at least 1500 Chinatown residents by name, residence and occupation. Managers lived onsite and kept the switchboard operating 365 days a year. The exchange operated until 1949 and the landmark was bought and restored by Bank of Canton in 1960.	Since anyone born in China was prohibited by US law from visiting San Francisco throughout the 1882–1943 Chinese Exclusion era, this switchboard was the main means of contact with family and business partners in China for 60 years.

George Sterling Park	usa	san-francisco	activity	'Homeward into the sunset/Still unwearied we go/Till the northern hills are misty/With the amber of afterglow.' Poet George Sterling's City by the Sea is almost maudlin – that is, until you watch the sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge from his namesake hilltop park – the perfect vantage point over the 'cool grey city of love.'	 Sterling was a great romancer of all San Francisco offered – nature, idealism, free love and opium – and was frequently broke. But as  toast of the secretive, elite Bohemian Club, San Francisco's high society indulged the poet in his eccentricities, which included carrying a lethal dose of cyanide as a reminder of life's transience. Broken by his ex-wife's suicide and loss of his best friend, novelist Jack London, the 'King of Bohemia' apparently took this bitter dose in 1926 inside his apartment at the club. Afterward, his influential friends named this park – with zigzagging paths and stirring, Sterling views – for him.If you're not  breathless from these hilltop vistas, play tennis on the adjacent public court named after San Francisco's Alice Marble, the 1930s tennis champ who recovered from tuberculosis to win Wimbledon and serve during WWII as a US secret agent among Nazis. Sure puts a little post-tennis panting into perspective, doesn't it?

Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain	usa	san-francisco	activity	Covered in local landmarks and colorful SF characters, Ruth Asawa's 1973 San Francisco Fountain captures the city's spirit. Sculptor Asawa used unconventional techniques: she collected favorite images of San Francisco from 250 people – famous artists to schoolchildren – sculpted them in bread dough, then cast them in bronze. Apple Inc. designed its flagship store for this spot, but there was a public outcry defending the fountain – so Apple eventually redesigned its building around it and restored the fountain.
