usa	new-york-city	Metropolitan Museum of Art	This sprawling encyclopedic museum, founded in 1870, houses one of the biggest art collections in the world. Its permanent collection has more than two million individual objects, from Egyptian temples to American paintings. Known colloquially as ‘The Met,’ the museum attracts almost six million visitors a year to its 17 acres of galleries – making it the largest single-site attraction in New York City. (Yup, you read that right: 17 acres.) In other words, plan on spending some time here. It is B-I-G.The museum has an unrivaled collection of ancient Egyptian art, some of which dates back to the Paleolithic era. Located to the north of the Great Hall, the 39 Egyptian galleries open dramatically with one of the Met’s prized pieces: the Mastaba Tomb of Perneb (c 2300 BC), an Old Kingdom burial chamber crafted from limestone.On the museum’s second floor, the European Paintings’ galleries display a stunning collection of masterworks. The ‘New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia’ are comprised of 15 incredible rooms that showcase the museum’s extensive collection of art from the Middle East and Central and South Asia.In the northwest corner, the recently revamped American galleries showcase a wide variety of decorative and fine art from throughout US history. The 27 galleries devoted to classical antiquity are another Met doozy, some of which are dramatically illuminated by natural daylight.The most popular galleries with children are generally the Egyptian galleries, the Africa and Oceania galleries (great masks) and the collection of medieval arms and armor – all of which are on the first floor. The Met hosts plenty of kid-centric happenings (check the website) and distributes a special museum brochure and map made specifically for the tykes. Inquire at the information desk.One of the best spots in the entire museum is the roof garden, which features rotating sculpture installations by contemporary and 20th century artists. (Sol Lewitt, Jeff Koons and Andy Goldsworthy have all shown here). But its best feature is the views it offers of the city and Central Park. It is also home to the Roof Garden Café & Martini Bar, the best place in the museum for a sip — especially at sunset. The roof garden is open from April to October. A desk inside the Great Hall has audio tours in several languages ($7), while docents offer guided tours of specific galleries. These are free with admission. Check the website or information desk for details. If you can’t stand crowds, avoid weekends.	210	-73.9632184289	40.7793936338	6.0	19349	4014	708	112	50	5.0	['10:00 - 17:30', '34:00 - 41:30', '58:00 - 65:30', '82:00 - 89:30', '106:00 - 113:30', '130:00 - 141:00', '154:00 - 165:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Lincoln Center	This stark arrangement of gleaming Modernist temples contains some of Manhattan’s most important performance spaces: Avery Fisher Hall (home to the New York Philharmonic), David H Koch Theater (site of the New York City ballet), and the iconic Metropolitan Opera House, whose interior walls are dressed with brightly saturated murals by painter Marc Chagall. Various other venues are tucked in and around the 16-acre campus, including a theater, two film screening centers and the renowned Juilliard School.Built in the 1960s, this imposing campus replaced a group of tenements called San Juan Hill, a predominantly African American neighborhood where the exterior shots for the movie West Side Story were filmed. In addition to being a controversial urban planning move, Lincoln Center wasn’t exactly well-received at an architectural level – it was relentlessly criticized for its conservative design, fortress-like aspect and poor acoustics. For the center’s 50th anniversary (2009–10), Diller Scofidio + Renfro and other architects gave the complex a much-needed and critically-acclaimed freshening up.A survey of the three classic buildings surrounding Revson Fountain is a must. These include the Metropolitan Opera, Avery Fisher Hall and the David H Koch Theater, the latter designed by Philip Johnson. The fountain is spectacular in the evenings when it puts on Las Vegas–like light shows. (These are all located on the main plaza at Columbus Ave, between 62nd and 65th Sts)Of the refurbished structures, there are a number that are worth examining, including Alice Tully Hall , now displaying a very contemporary translucent, angled facade, and the David Rubenstein Atrium , a public space offering a lounge area (free wi-fi), a cafe, an information desk and a ticket vendor plying day-of discount tickets to Lincoln Center performances. Free events are held here on Thursday evenings.On any given night, there are at least 10 performances happening throughout Lincoln Center – and even more in summer, when Lincoln Center Out of Doors (a series of dance and music concerts) and Midsummer Night Swing (ballroom dancing under the stars) lure those who love parks and culture. For details on seasons, tickets and programming – which runs the gamut from opera to dance to theater to ballet – turn to the Entertainment section of this chapter.Daily tours of the complex explore the Metropolitan Opera House, Revson Fountain and Alice Tully Hall and are a great way to get acquainted with the complex.		-73.984554	40.772861	5.5	1386	381	67	16	5	4.5	[]	['Theaters', 'Theater & Concerts']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Central Park	Like the city’s subway system, the vast and majestic Central Park, an 843-acre rectangle of open space in the middle of Manhattan, is a great class leveler – which is exactly what it was envisioned to be. Created in the 1860s and ’70s by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the marshy northern fringe of the city, the immense park was designed as a leisure space for all New Yorkers, regardless of color, class or creed. And it’s an oasis from the insanity: the lush lawns, cool forests, flowering gardens, glassy bodies of water and meandering, wooded paths providing the dose of serene nature that New Yorkers crave.Olmsted and Vaux (who also created Prospect Park in Brooklyn) were determined to keep foot and road traffic separate and cleverly designed the crosstown transverses under elevated roads to do so. That such a large expanse of prime real estate has survived intact for so long again proves that nothing eclipses the heart, soul and pride that forms the foundation of New York City’s greatness.Today, this ‘people’s park’ is still one of the city’s most popular attractions, beckoning throngs of New Yorkers with free outdoor concerts at the Great Lawn, precious animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center and top-notch drama at the annual Shakespeare in the Park productions, held each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater. Some other recommended stops include the ornate Bethesda Fountain, which edges the Lake and its Loeb Boathouse, where you can rent rowboats or enjoy lunch at an outdoor cafe; the Shakespeare Garden (west side btwn 79th & 80th Sts), which has lush plantings and excellent skyline views; and the Ramble (mid-park from 73rd to 79th Sts), a wooded thicket that’s popular with bird-watchers. While parts of the park swarm with joggers, in-line skaters, musicians and tourists on warm weekends, it’s quieter on weekday afternoons – but especially in less well-trodden spots above 72nd St such as the Harlem Meer and the North Meadow (north of 97th St).Folks flock to the park even in winter, when snowstorms can inspire cross-country skiing and sledding or a simple stroll through the white wonderland, and crowds turn out every New Year’s Eve for a midnight run. The Central Park Conservancy offers ever-changing guided tours of the park, including those that focus on public art, wildlife and places of interest to kids.	210	-73.9660514936	40.7824938935	5.5	37302	10024	1371	118	34	4.5	['6:00 - 25:00', '30:00 - 49:00', '54:00 - 73:00', '78:00 - 97:00', '102:00 - 121:00', '126:00 - 145:00', '150:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 1:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Brooklyn Bridge	A New York icon, the Brooklyn Bridge was the world’s first steel suspension bridge. When it opened in 1883, the 1596ft span between its two support towers was the longest in history. Although its construction was fraught with disaster, the bridge became a magnificent example of urban design, inspiring poets, writers and painters. Today, the Brooklyn Bridge continues to dazzle – many regard it as the most beautiful bridge in the world.The Prussian-born engineer John Roebling, who was knocked off a pier in Fulton Landing in June 1869, designed the bridge, which spans the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn; he died of tetanus poisoning before construction of the bridge even began. His son, Washington Roebling, supervised construction of the bridge, which lasted 14 years and managed to survive budget overruns and the deaths of 20 workers. The younger Roebling himself suffered from the bends while helping to excavate the riverbed for the bridge’s western tower and remained bedridden for much of the project; his wife Emily oversaw construction in his stead. There was one final tragedy to come in June 1883, when the bridge opened to pedestrian traffic. Someone in the crowd shouted, perhaps as a joke, that the bridge was collapsing into the river, setting off a mad rush in which 12 people were trampled to death.The bridge entered its second century as strong and beautiful as ever following an extensive renovation in the early 1980s. The pedestrian walkway that begins just east of City Hall affords a wonderful view of lower Manhattan; observation points under the support towers offer brass ‘panorama’ histories of the waterfront. Just take care to stay on the side of the walkway marked for folks on foot – one half is designated for cyclists, who use it en masse for both commuting and pleasure rides, and frustrated pedalers have been known to get nasty with oblivious tourists who wander, camera pressed to an eye, into the bike lane. Barring any such run-ins, you should reach Brooklyn after about a 20-minute walk. Bear left to Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park or Cadman Plaza West, which runs alongside Middagh St in the heart of Brooklyn Heights, taking you to Brooklyn’s downtown area; Don't miss the ornate Brooklyn Borough Hall and the Brooklyn Heights promenade.	90	-73.998413	40.707368	4.5	4984	1850	273	37	9	4.5	[]	['Bridges', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	American Museum of Natural History	Founded in 1869, this classic museum contains a veritable wonderland of more 30 million artifacts, including lots of menacing dinosaur skeletons, as well as the Rose Center for Earth & Space, with its cutting-edge planetarium. From October through May, the museum is home to the Butterfly Conservatory, a glass-house featuring 500-plus butterflies from all over the world.On the natural history side, the museum is perhaps best known for its Fossil Halls, containing nearly 600 specimens on view, including the skeletons of a massive mammoth and a fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex.There are also plentiful animal exhibits (the stuffed Alaskan brown bears are popular), galleries devoted to gems and an IMAX theater that plays films on natural phenomena. The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life contains dioramas devoted to ecologies, weather and conservation, as well as a beloved 94ft replica of a blue whale. At the 77th St Lobby Gallery, visitors are greeted by a 63ft canoe carved by the Haida people of British Columbia in the middle of the 19th century.For the space set, it’s the Rose Center that is the star of the show. With its mesmerizing glass box facade, home to space-show theaters and the planetarium – it is indeed an otherworldly setting. Every half-hour between 10:30am and 4:30pm, you can drop yourself into a cushy seat to view Dark Universe, which explores the mysteries and wonders of the cosmos.Celebrities provide narration for some of the films: Meryl Streep gives us the evolutionary lowdown on vertebrates on the fourth floor, while Liam Neeson narrates the four-minute Big Bang, which is a fine entry to exploring the rest of the Rose Center.	210	-73.9740213241	40.7809563762	5.5	4287	2054	875	297	111	4.5	['10:00 - 17:45', '34:00 - 41:45', '58:00 - 65:45', '82:00 - 89:45', '106:00 - 113:45', '130:00 - 137:45', '154:00 - 161:45']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Museum of Modern Art	Founded in 1929, MoMA is one of NYC’s most popular museums, home to more than 100,000 pieces of modern artwork, most by A-listers – Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rothko, Pollock, Bourgeois and many others. It’s dedicated to showcasing artwork based on the emerging creative ideas of the late 19th century through to those that dominate today. It’s easy to get lost in the vast collection for an entire day; if you want to maximize your time and create a plan of attack ahead of time, download the museum’s floor plan and visitor guide from the website beforehand. MoMA's permanent collection spans four levels, with prints, illustrated books and the unmissable Contemporary Galleries on level two; architecture, design, drawings and photography on level three; and painting and sculpture on levels four and five. Many of the big hitters are on these last two levels, so tackle the museum from the top down before the fatigue sets in. Must-sees include Van Gogh's The Starry Night, Cézanne's The Bather, Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, and Henri Rousseau's The Sleeping Gypsy, not to mention iconic American works like Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans and Gold Marilyn Monroe, Lichtenstein's equally poptastic Girl With Ball, and Hopper's haunting House by the Railroad .	210	-73.977226	40.761195	5.5	3558	1525	615	197	99	4.5	['130:30 - 140:00', '10:30 - 17:30', '34:30 - 41:30', '58:30 - 65:30', '82:30 - 89:30', '106:30 - 113:30', '154:30 - 161:30']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	The High Line	For years now, the big buzz in Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen has been all about the coming of the High Line, the first section of which finally and officially opened to the public in the summer of 2009. Now you can stroll, sit and picnic 30ft above the city below on what was, since the 1960s, an abandoned stretch of elevated railroad track. The perks thus far are numerous, and include stunning vistas of the Hudson River, public art installations, fat lounge chairs for soaking up some sun, willowy stretches of native-inspired landscaping (including a mini-forest of trees), a cupcake vendor and a thoroughly unique perspective on the neighborhood streets below – especially at the cool Gansevoort Overlook, where bleacher-like seating faces a huge pane of glass that allows you to view the traffic, buildings and pedestrians below as living works of urban art. There’s also Andre Balazs’ luxury hotel, the Standard (similar to his others in LA and Miami), which straddles the park, as well as a still-to-come branch of the Whitney Museum, which will reside at the southern end.

usa	new-york-city	Frick Collection	This spectacular art collection sits in a mansion built by prickly steel magnate Henry Clay Frick, one of the many such residences that made up Millionaires’ Row. The museum has over a dozen splendid rooms that display masterpieces by Titian, Vermeer, Gilbert Stuart, El Greco and Goya.This museum is a treat for a number of reasons. One, it resides in a lovely, rambling beaux arts structure built from 1913–14 by Carrère and Hastings. Two, it is generally not crowded (one exception being during popular shows, such as a Vermeer and Rembrandt exhibit held in 2013). And, three, it feels refreshingly intimate, with a trickling indoor courtyard fountain and gardens that can be explored on warmer days. A demure Portico Gallery, opened in 2011, displays decorative works and sculpture.A worthwhile audio tour (available in several languages) is included in the price of admission.

usa	new-york-city	Cathedral Church of St John the Divine	The largest place of worship in the United States has yet to be completed – and probably won’t be any time soon. But this storied Episcopal cathedral nonetheless commands attention with its ornate Byzantine-style facade, booming vintage organ and extravagantly scaled nave – twice as wide as Westminster Abbey in London.Founded in the 19th century by Bishop Horatio Potter, the first cornerstone for the Cathedral was laid on St John’s Day in 1892. But the construction – as its incomplete state will attest – was hardly smooth. The engineers had to dig 70ft in order to find bedrock to which they could anchor the building. Architects died and were fired. And in 1911, the initial Romanesque design was exchanged for something bigger and more Gothic. Construction has been halted on countless occasions (whenever funds run out). To this day, the north tower remains unbuilt, and a ‘temporary’ domed roof, constructed out of terra-cotta tile in 1909, still shelters the Crossing. In 2001, there was a raging fire to contend with, too. Much of the church has since been restored, but the north transept, which was severely damaged, has not been rebuilt. If it is ever completed, the 601ft-long Cathedral will rank as the third-largest church in the world, after St Peter’s Basilica in Rome and Basilica of Our Lady of Peace at Yamoussoukro in Côte d’Ivoire. Just don’t count on this happening any time soon.Framing the western entrance are two rows of Gothic-inspired sculptures that were carved in the 1980s and '90s by British artist Simon Verity (b 1945). On the central pillar stands St John the Divine himself, author of the Book of Revelation . (Note the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse under his feet.) Flanking him are various biblical figures, including Moses, John the Baptist and Noah. Themes of devastation are rife, but most unnerving is the statue of Jeremiah (third on the right), which stands on a base that shows the New York City skyline – Twin Towers included – in the process of being destroyed. The nave is laid out west to east. Lining this monumental passageway are two magisterial sets of 17th century tapestries. The Barberini Tapestries from Italy depict scenes from the life of Christ, while the Mortlake Tapestries, based on cartoons by Raphael, show the Acts of the Apostles . Installed in 1932, the largest stained glass window in the country contains more than 10,000 individual pieces of glass. The design features a red-robed image of Christ at the center, from which trumpet-bearing angels radiate outward to the prophets. One of the most powerful organs in the world, the Great Organ was originally installed in 1911 and then enlarged and rebuilt in 1952. It contains 8035 pipes arranged in 141 ranks. The 2001 fire damaged the instrument, but a careful five-year restoration brought it back. You can hear it roar during services and concerts. Behind the choir is the silver triptych ‘Life of Christ,’ carved by '80s pop artist Keith Haring (1958–90). It's one of the last works of art he produced prior to succumbing to an AIDS-related illness at the age of 31.The Cathedral is situated on a lovely 11-acre plot. On the south side of the building, you’ll find the whimsical Children’s Sculpture Garden (check out the bizarre Peace Fountain, which shows the archangel Michael and Satan doing battle) and the Biblical Garden, containing plants mentioned in the Bible.Tours are offered at 11am and 1pm Saturdays and at 1pm Sundays. Vertical tours, which take you on a steep climb to the top of the Cathedral (bring your own flashlight), are at noon and 2pm Saturdays. Regular prayer services are held four times daily (see the website for the schedule). Two special services worth seeing are the annual Blessing of the Animals, a pilgrimage for pet owners held on the first Sunday of October, and the Blessing of the Bikes, held on May 1, when local riders tool in on everything from sleek 10-speeds to clunky cruisers. If attending a regular service, remain seated and refrain from taking pictures.	90	-73.9624416338	40.8040671139	5.5	337	174	33	8	1	4.5	[]	['Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Ellis Island	An icon of mythical proportions for the descendents of those who passed through here, this island and its hulking building served as New York’s main immigration station from 1892 until 1954, processing the amazing number of 12,000 individuals daily, from countries including Ireland, England, Germany and Austria. The process involved getting the once-over by doctors, being assigned new names if their own were too difficult to spell or pronounce, and basically getting the green light to start their new, hopeful and often frighteningly difficult lives here in the teeming city of New York. In its later years, after WWI and during the paranoia of the ‘Red Scare’ in this country, the immigration center became more of a de facto holding pen for newcomers believed to be radical threats to the US. After admitting its last arrival in 1954 (a Norwegian merchant seaman), the place closed due to changes in immigration law coupled with rising operating costs.Now anybody who rides the ferry to the island can get a cleaned-up, modern version of the historic new-arrival experience, thanks to the impressive Immigration Museum that’s housed in the massive, beautifully detailed, red-brick structure. It was reopened in 1990 after a $160 million restoration project, and now lets you explore the history of the island through a series of interactive galleries. The exhibits emphasize that, contrary to popular myth, most of the ship-borne immigrants were processed within eight hours and that conditions were generally clean and safe, especially for 1st- and 2nd-class passengers, who were processed on board their ships; only immigrants from the steerage class were subject to whatever conditions prevailed on Ellis Island. The 338ft-long registry room, with its beautiful vaulted tile ceiling, is where the polygamists, paupers, criminals and anarchists were turned around and sent back from whence they came. Walking through the roomy, light-filled registry today is probably quite a contrast to the reality faced by thousands of newly arrived foreigners back in its heyday. But you’ll experience a new kind of crowding, as about two million people now visit Ellis Island annually.To get the most out of your visit, opt for the 50-minute self-guided audio tour ($8, available from the museum lobby). Featuring narratives from a number of sources, including historians, architects and the immigrants themselves, the tour brings to life museum's hefty collection of personal objects, official documents, photographs and film footage. It's an evocative experience to relive personal memories – both good and bad – in the very halls and corridors in which they occurred. If you don't feel like opting for the audio tour, you can always pick up one of the phones in each display area and listen to the recorded, yet affecting memories of real Ellis Island immigrants, taped in the 1980s. Another option is the free, 45-minute guided tour with a park ranger (also available in American Sign Language).	120	-74.0422998592	40.6995839483	5.5	1097	685	265	76	30	4.5	['9:00 - 16:00', '33:00 - 40:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']	['History Museums', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Union Square	Union Sq is like the Noah’s Ark of New York, rescuing at least two of every kind from the curling seas of concrete. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find a more eclectic cross-section of locals gathered in one public place. Here, amid the tapestry of stone steps and fenced-in foliage it’s not uncommon to find denizens of every ilk: suited businessfolk gulping fresh air during their lunch breaks, dreadlocked loiterers tapping beats on their tabla, skateboarding punks flipping tricks on the southeastern stairs, rowdy college kids guzzling student-priced eats, and throngs of protesting masses chanting fervently for various causes. Opened in 1831, Union Sq quickly became the central gathering place for those who lived in the mansions nearby. Concert halls and artist societies further enhanced the cultured atmosphere, and high-end shopping quickly proliferated along Broadway, which was dubbed ‘Ladies’ Mile’.When the Civil War broke out, the vast public space (large by New York standards, of course) was center stage for protesters of all sorts – from union workers to political activists. By the height of the WWI, the area had fallen largely into disuse, allowing politically and socially driven organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the Communist and Socialist Parties and the Ladies’ Garment Workers Union to move in.The square is still the site for political and social protests today. After over a century of the continuous push-and-pull between dapper-dom and political protest, a third – artistic, if not thoroughly hippie-ish – ingredient was tossed into the mix when Andy Warhol moved his Factory to Union Sq West. The building is now a Puma sportswear store – a telling sign of the times. A walk around Union Sq will reveal almost a dozen notable pieces of art – there’s Rob Pruitt’s 10-feet homage to Andy Warhol (erected on the exact spot where he was shot by Valerie Solanas), and the imposing equestrian statue of George Washington (one of the first public pieces of art in New York City). But on the south side of the square sits a massive art installation that either earns confused stares or simply gets overlooked by passersby. A symbolic representation of the passage of time, Metronome has two parts – a digital clock with a puzzling display of numbers, and a wand-like apparatus with smoke puffing out of concentric rings. We’ll let you ponder the latter while we give you the skinny on what exactly the winking orange digits denote: the 14 numbers must be split into two groups of seven – the seven from the left tell the current time (hour, minute, second, tenth-of-a-second) and the seven from the right are meant to be read in reverse order; they represent the remaining amount of time in the day.	210	-73.99070689	40.73580003	5.0	281	303	92	8	3	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	MoMA PS1	Sorry, Gaga, but New York's true icon of edge is MoMA PS1. This smaller, hipper relative of Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art is a master at hunting down fresh, bold contemporary art and serving it up in a Berlin-esque, ex-school locale. Forget about pretty lily ponds in gilded frames. Here you'll be peering at videos through floorboards, schmoozing at DJ-pimped parties, and debating the meaning of nonstatic structures while staring through a hole in the wall. Expect over 50 exhibitions a year, exploring anything from Middle Eastern video art to giant mounds of thread. Nothing is predictable. Even a 2011 exhibition honoring the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 took a different route, ditching catastrophic images for an exploration of how the event has reshaped people's visual perceptions. Best of all, admission is free with your MoMA ticket – so hold on tight!It's not just the art that draws the crowds. Head in on Saturday afternoons from July to early September, and rock on at one of New York's coolest weekly music/culture events, Warm Up. It's a hit with everyone from verified hipsters to plugged-in music geeks, who spill into the MoMA PS1 courtyard to eat, drink, catch kooky performances and get their general groove on. The tunes are the main attraction, with a stellar line-up of top bands, experimental music and DJs each week. Featured artists have included Omar-S, Tanlines, NGUZUNGUZU and acid-house pioneer DJ Pierre. It's like one big block party, albeit with better music and art than your usual neighborhood slap-up. Not bad for $15. Linked to the fun is the annual YAP (Young Architects Program) competition, which sees emerging architects competing for the chance to transform the MoMA PS1 courtyard. Nabbing the prize in 2011 was Brooklyn's Interboro Partners, whose installation graced the space with a sexy, striking canopy of white sails and ropes. The initiative has now gone global, with an international edition held at Rome's Zaha Hadid–designed MAXXI museum.Another treat for culture vultures is the Saturday Sessions, taking place from 3pm to 5pm, every second Saturday from January to late spring. Spanning lectures and film screenings to music performances and even architectural projects, the inspired lineup has included experimental comedy, postindustrial noise jams and Latin art-house dance. One week you might catch a symphony debut, another your taste buds might get involved, as was the case when artist Anne Apparu hosted an afternoon of sweet tea and 'inner-war' cookies (an original recipe meant to trigger collective meditations on violence and community). Upcoming events are listed on the MoMA PS1 website.	120	-73.947161	40.745396	5.0	87	60	36	9	7	4.0	['24:00 - 42:00', '48:00 - 66:00', '120:00 - 138:00', '144:00 - 162:00', '168:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 18:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Studio Museum in Harlem	This small, cultural gem has been exhibiting the works of African American artists for more than four decades. While its rotating exhibition program is always challenging, the museum is not just another art display center. It is an important point of connection for Harlem cultural figures of all stripes, who arrive to check out a rotating selection of shows, attend film screenings or sign up for gallery talks.Founded in 1968, the museum originally came to life in a small loft space off 125th St that was sandwiched between a couple of garment factories and a supermarket. But it quickly became known for its thoughtful, contemporary-minded exhibits and vibrant event programming, which included concerts, poetry readings and lectures. Roughly a dozen years after its establishment, it moved to its present location, a renovated bank building that offered more room for exhibits, archives and the growing permanent collection. You'll also find the Harlem Visitor Information Kiosk located here.The permanent collection is small (roughly 1700 objects), but it is rich. The Studio Museum has been an important patron to African American artists and the collection features work by more than 400 of them. This includes important pieces by painter Jacob Lawrence, photographer Gordon Parks and collagist Romare Bearden – all of whom are represented in major museum collections in the US.In addition, its photography holdings include an extensive archive of work by James VanDerZee (1886–1983), an unparalleled chronicler of early 20th century Harlem life. He shot portraits of prominent entertainers and black nationalists, and continued to take pictures well into his nineties. One well-known snap shows Jean-Michel Basquiat, the '80s graffiti artist and painter, sitting pensively with a Siamese cat on his lap.Look up on your way in. One of the museum’s most iconic works hangs right outside the front door: Hammons’ 1990 piece ‘African-American Flag’ replaces the traditional red, white and blue of the Stars and Stripes with the red, green and black of the pan-African flag. It is a sly comment on the African American presence in the US.The museum’s long-running artist-in-residence program has provided crucial support to a long list of well-known artists, including conceptualist David Hammons, figurative painter Mickalene Thomas and portraitist Kehinde Wiley. There are regular open studio sessions (check the website) and residents’ works can often be found on display in the out-of-the-way basement gallery or in one of the small display areas upstairs.	120	-73.9478578253	40.8086420983	4.5	12	17	1	1	0	4.5	['24:00 - 42:00', '120:00 - 141:00', '144:00 - 165:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Rockefeller Center	This 22-acre 'city within a city' debuted at the height of the Great Depression. Taking nine years to build, it was America's first multiuse retail, entertainment and office space – a modernist sprawl of 19 buildings (14 of which are the original art deco structures), outdoor plazas and big-name tenants. Developer John D Rockefeller Jr may have sweated over the cost (a mere $100 million), but it was all worth it, the Center declared a National Landmark in 1987.There are views, and then there is the view from the Top of the Rock . Crowning the GE Building, 70 stories above Midtown, its jaw-dropping vista includes one icon that you won't see from atop the Empire State Building – the Empire State Building. The Chrysler Building, however, is partially obscured. Heading up to watch the sun set over the city is worth the price hike.Rockefeller Center is graced with the creations of 30 great artists, commissioned around the punchy theme ‘Man at the Crossroads Looks Uncertainly But Hopefully at the Future.’ Paul Manship contributed Prometheus, overlooking the sunken plaza, and Atlas, in front of the International Building (630 Fifth Ave). Isamu Noguchi's News sits above the entrance to the Associated Press Building (50 Rockefeller Plaza), while José Maria Sert's oil American Progress awaits in the lobby of the GE Building. The latter work replaced Mexican artist Diego Rivera's original painting, rejected by the Rockefellers for containing ‘communist imagery.’TV comedy 30 Rock gets its name from the GE Building, and the tower is the real-life home of NBC TV. NBC Studio Tours leave from inside the NBC Experience Store every 15 minutes, and includes a sneak peak of the legendary Saturday Night Live set. Tours last 70 minutes, and there's a strict ‘no bathrooms, policy ’ so empty your bladder beforehand! Advanced phone bookings are strongly recommended. Across 49th St, opposite the plaza, is the glass-enclosed NBC Today show studio, broadcasting live, 7am to 10am daily.Come the festive season, Rockefeller Plaza is where you'll find New York's most famous Christmas tree. Ceremoniously lit just after Thanksgiving, it's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s, when construction workers set up a small tree on the site. In its shadow, Rink at Rockefeller Center is the city's most famous ice-skating rink. Incomparably magical, it's also undeniably small and crowded. Opt for the first skating period (8.30am) to avoid a long wait. Come summer, the rink becomes a cafe.	90	-73.9787344655	40.758784834	4.5	4373	2098	494	60	20	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	City Hall	This elegant, cupola-topped marble hall, located in placid City Hall Park facing the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, has been home to New York City’s government since 1812. In keeping with the half-baked civic planning that has often plagued large-scale New York projects, officials neglected to finish the building’s northern side in marble, due to objections about cost. Finishing the northern facade in brownstone and reducing the size of the building overall made a compromise. The domed tower was rebuilt in 1917 after being damaged by two fires, and the original marble (and brownstone) facades were replaced with limestone over a granite base in 1954–56. Its beautiful restoration prompted critic Ada Louise Huxtable to call it a ‘symbol of taste, excellence and quality not always matched by the policies inside.’After climbing the formal staircase out front – the site of constant press conferences, as well as civil demonstrations (with pre-arranged permits) – you’ll soon find yourself under the soaring rotunda, which is supported by 10 Corinthian columns on the 2nd floor. One highlight inside includes the spot where Abraham Lincoln’s coffin lay in state for a brief time in 1865 (look at the top of the staircase on the 2nd floor). The Governor’s Room, a reception area where the mayor entertains important guests, contains 12 portraits of the founding fathers by John Trumbull, George Washington’s old writing table and other examples of Federal-style furniture, and the remnants of a flag flown at the first president’s 1789 inaugural ceremony. If you take a quick peek into the City Council chambers, you might even see lawmakers of the 51-member body deliberating over issues such as urban development, the budget or civil rights.You can also explore the grand interior of City Hall through free Guided Tours offered by the Art Commission of the City of New York (call for reservations).Out front is bustling City Hall Park, graced with gas lamps, fountains, lovely landscaping, chess tables and benches, making it a nice place to sit with a sandwich for some prime people-watching. Hot months brings Summerfest, a concert series of live R&amp;B and jazz, on weekends. Adding to the excitement here is the fact that it’s often edged by people protesting on one issue or another, unless the groups have planned ahead and gotten a protest permit (required by Mayor Bloomberg for demonstrations within the actual park or on the steps of City Hall).	90	-74.0060080666	40.7127476298	5.0	22	24	13	1	0	4.0	[]	['Government Buildings', 'Visitor Centers', 'Traveler Resources', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Empire State Building	Featured prominently in almost a hundred Hollywood films over the years, the Empire State Building – actually a very glorified office building – is the most famous member of the New York skyline. It’s a limestone classic built in just 410 days (using seven million hours of labor) during the Great Depression, at the astounding cost of $41 million. Located on the site of the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the 102-story, 1472ft-high (to the top of the antenna) Empire State Building opened in 1931 after the laying of 10 million bricks, installation of 6400 windows and setting of 328,000 sq ft of marble. The famous antenna was originally meant to be a mooring mast for zeppelins, but the Hindenberg disaster slammed the brakes on that plan. Later an aircraft did (accidentally) meet up with the building: a B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor on a foggy day in 1945, killing 14 people.The view of the vast city from the Empire State Building is just exquisite, but be prepared – the lines to get to the observation decks, found on the 86th and 102nd floors, are notorious. And the basement area where you must buy tickets and queue up for the elevator ride is a shabby, poorly ventilated waiting pen, especially in summer. Getting here very early or very late will help you avoid delays – as will buying your tickets ahead of time, online, where an extra $2 purchase charge is well worth the hassle it will save you. Sunset is one of the most magical times to be up here because you can see the city don its nighttime cloak in dusk’s afterglow. Once up here, you can stay as long as you like. Coin-operated telescopes offer an up-close glimpse of the city, and diagrams map out the major sights. You can even smoke up top, to the great dismay of many non- Europeans.Since 1976, the building’s top 30 floors have been floodlit in seasonal and holiday colors: green for St Patrick’s Day in March, black for World AIDS Day on December 1, red and green for Christmas, lavender for Gay Pride weekend in June, etc – visit the website for each day’s lighting scheme and meaning. This tradition has now been copied by many other skyscrapers, notably the Metropolitan Life Tower at Madison Square Park and the Con Edison Tower near Union Sq, lending elegance to the night sky.	90	-73.985506	40.748338	4.5	12244	5751	1998	701	484	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Governors Island	Off-limits to the public for 200 years, former military outpost Governors island is now one of New York's most popular seasonal playgrounds. Each summer, free ferries make the seven-minute trip from Lower Manhattan to the 172-acre oasis. Among the island's draws is Picnic Point, an 8-acre patch of green with picnic tables and hammocks; Figment (www.figmentproject.org), a one-weekend-only interactive art festival in June; and Water Taxi Beach , a spit of sand that hosts events from dance parties to live concerts. Then there's the smooth, 2.2-mile bicycle path around the perimeter of the entire island, which you can pedal with rental bikes from Bike & Roll for $15 per two hours (free on Fridays). Commencing in 2012, a major redevelopment of the island will see the addition of a striking new park across its southern half, commercial developments at its eastern and western ends, and a wide new promenade around its perimeter.Besides serving as a successful military fort in the Revolutionary War, the Union Army’s central recruiting station during the Civil War and the take-off point for Wilbur Wright’s famous 1909 flight around the Statue of Liberty, Governors Island is where the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev summit signaled the beginning of the end of the Cold War. You can visit the spot where that famous summit took place at the Admiral’s House , a grand-colonnaded, 1843 military residence that’s part of the elegant ghost-town area of Nolan Park. Other historic spots include Fort Jay , fortified in 1776 for what became a failed attempt to prevent the Brits from invading Manhattan; Colonel’s Row , a collection of lovely, 19th-century brick officers’ quarters; and the creepy Castle Williams , a 19th-century fort that was eventually used as a military penitentiary. The best way to explore it all is with the National Park Service (www.www.nps.gov/gois/index.htm), whose rangers conduct 90-minute guided tours of the historic district, usually on Wednesdays and Thursdays.	210	None	None	5.5	219	108	19	5	2	4.5	[]	['Islands', 'Military Bases & Facilities', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Times Square	Love it or hate it, the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Ave (better known as Times Square) is New York City's hyperactive heart; a restless, hypnotic torrent of glittering lights, bombastic billboards and raw urban energy. It's not hip, fashionable or in-the-know, and it couldn't care less. It's too busy pumping out iconic, mass-marketed NYC – yellow cabs, golden arches, soaring skyscrapers and razzle-dazzle Broadway marquees. This is the New York of collective fantasies – the place where Al Jolson 'makes it' in the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, where photojournalist Alfred Eisenstaedt famously captured a lip-locked sailor and nurse on V-J Day in 1945, and where Alicia Keys and Jay-Z waxed lyrically about this 'concrete jungle where dreams are made.'For several decades, the dream here was a sordid, wet one. The economic crash of the early 1970s led to a mass exodus of corporations from Times Square. Billboard niches went dark, stores shut and once grand hotels were converted into SROs (single-room occupancy) dives, attracting the poor and the destitute. What was once an area bathed in light and showbiz glitz became a dirty den of drug dealers and crime. While the adjoining Theater District survived, its respectable playhouses shared the streets with porn cinemas, strip clubs and adult bookstores. That all changed with tough-talking mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, in the 1990s, forced out the skin flicks, boosted police numbers and lured a wave of 'respectable' retail chains, restaurants and attractions. By the new millennium, Times Square had gone from 'X-rated' to 'G-rated,' drawing almost 40 million visitors annually.For a panoramic overview over the square, order a drink at the Renaissance Hotel's R Lounge, which offers floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the neon-lit spectacle. It might not be the best-priced sip in town, but with a view like this, who's counting?	90	-73.9865326881	40.7562858733	5.5	7088	2944	1239	385	244	4.5	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Mulberry Street	Named for the mulberry farms that once stood here, Mulberry St is now better known as the meat in Little Italy's sauce. It's an animated strip, packed with smooth-talking restaurant hawkers (especially between Hester and Grand Sts), wisecracking baristas and a healthy dose of kitschy souvenirs.Despite the neighborhood's many changes over the years, history looms large. It was inside restaurant Da Gennaro , formerly Umberto's Clam House, that 'Crazy Joe' Gallo was gunned down on 2 April 1972, an unexpected birthday surprise for the Brooklyn-born mobster. One block further north stands fourth-generation Alleva , one of the city's original cheese shops and famed for its mozzarella. Across the street on Grand lies another veteran, Ferrara Cafe & Bakery , celebrated for its classic Italian pastries and gelati. Back on Mulberry, old-time Mulberry Street Bar was a favorite haunt of the late Frank Sinatra, its own TV cameos including Law & Order and the Sopranos . Alcohol was openly traded on the corner of Mulberry and Kenmare Sts during Prohibition, leading to its nickname, the 'Curb Exchange.' That police headquarters at the time were only a block away at 240 Center St is testament to the power of good old-fashioned bribes. From this point north, the old-school delis and restaurants of Little Italy give way to the new-school boutiques, galleries and restaurants of Nolita. Take a gander at what was once the Ravenite Social Club to see how things have really changed around here. Now a designer shoe store, it was once a mobster hangout (originally known as the Alto Knights Social Club). Indeed, it was right here that big hitters such as Lucky Luciano and John Gotti (as well as the FBI, who kept a watchful eye from the building across the street) logged time. Only the shop's tile floor remains from the day, the shop windows once an intimidating brick wall.	90	-73.997533	40.718851	4.0	519	564	404	145	69	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Flatiron Building	Built in 1902, the 20-story Flatiron Building, designed by Daniel Burnham, has a uniquely narrow triangular footprint that resembles the prow of a massive ship, and a traditional beaux arts limestone facade, built over a steel frame, that gets more complex and beautiful the longer you stare at it. Best viewed from the traffic island north of 23rd St between Broadway and Fifth Ave, this unique structure dominated the plaza back in the skyscraper era of the early 1900s. In fact, until 1909 it was the world’s tallest building.The construction of the Flatiron building (originally known as the Fuller Building) coincided with the proliferation of mass-produced picture postcards – the partnership was kismet. Even before its completion, there were images of the soon-to-be tallest tower circulating the globe, creating much wonder and excitement.Publisher Frank Munsey was one of the building’s first tenants, and from his 18th-floor offices, published Munsey’s Magazine, which featured the writings of short-story writer William Sydney Porter, whose pen name was ‘O Henry’. His musings (in popular stories such as ‘The Gift of the Magi’), the paintings of John Sloan and photographs of Alfred Stieglitz, best immortalized the Flatiron back in the day – along with a famous comment by actress Katherine Hepburn, who said in an interview that she’d like to be admired as much as the grand old building.Like many of New York City’s monumental homages to civic progress, the Flatiron building is still fully functional and houses an assortment of private businesses. The famed structure is therefore best appreciated from the exterior. Plans are underway to transform the building into a luxurious five-star hotel, but progress is on permanent hold until the final tenants willingly vacate the premises.	90	-73.9896174468	40.7410157586	5.5	412	353	84	3	1	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Bronx Zoo	The country’s biggest and oldest zoo easily justifies a subway ride into the Bronx. Some two million visit each year, with daily numbers reaching 35,000 on discounted Wednesdays and weekends, and any day in July or August (try to go Monday morning). Opened in 1899, the 265-acre zoo, home to some 4000 animals, has leafy areas that re-create different world habitats – African plains and forests, Himalayan mountains, Asian rainforests. Even if you spring for a monorail or shuttle ride around the grounds, you really can’t see it all in a day. The best plan is to first grab a free map and find out when and where various ­animal-feeding sessions and demonstrations will be held that day (sea lions, penguins and tigers are good ones). Kids also enjoy camel rides and the bat-filled ‘World of Darkness.’ At Astor Court, surrounded by several landmark buildings, is the Madagascar exhibit, which opened in June 2008. Some attractions cost extra, like the wildly popular Congo Gorilla Forest, a 6.5-acre exhibit with gorillas and exhibits explaining conservation projects in the Congo (to which the ticket price is donated). The zoo has done many other good works over its hundred-plus years of existence. In the early 20th century, for one famous example, the collection of bison here were used to restock the wild population in their native Great Plains area of the country. There are five entrances to the zoo. By subway, it’s easiest via the southwest Asia Gate (a couple blocks north of the West Farms Sq–E Tremont Ave stop, up Boston Rd). Another option is aboard the BxM11 express bus, which comes from Manhattan via Madison Ave, stopping along Madison at 26th, 47th, 54th, 84th and 99th Sts every 20 minutes or so. For transport by car, there’s a parking lot near the Southern Blvd Gate on the zoo’s north side.	90	-73.8780699464	40.8531534254	5.5	939	452	113	51	36	4.5	['34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '10:00 - 17:30', '154:00 - 161:30']	['Nature & Wildlife Areas', 'Nature & Parks', 'Zoos & Aquariums', 'Outdoor Activities']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Tompkins Square Park	This 10.5-acre park honors Daniel Tompkins, who served as governor of New York from 1807 to 1817 (and as the nation’s vice president after that, under James Monroe). It’s like a friendly town square for locals, who gather for chess at concrete tables, picnics on the lawn on warm days and spontaneous guitar or drum jams on various grassy knolls. It’s also the site of basketball courts, a fun-to-watch dog run (a fenced-in area where humans can unleash their canines), frequent summer concerts and an always-lively kids’ playground. The park, which recently underwent a facelift, wasn’t always a place for such clean fun, however. In the ’80s, it was a dirty, needle-strewn homeless encampment, unusable for folks wanting a place to stroll or picnic. A contentious turning point came when police razed the band shell (where the legendary and now-defunct Wigstock dragfest was founded by Lady Bunny and cohorts) and evicted more than 100 squatters living in a tent city in the park in 1988 (and again in 1991). That first eviction turned violent; the Tompkins Square Riot, as it came to be known, ushered in the first wave of yuppies in the dog run, fashionistas lolling in the grass and undercover narcotics agents trying to pass as druggie punk kids. There’s not much drama here these days, unless you count the annual Howl! Festival of East Village Arts, which brings Allen Ginsberg–inspired theater, music, film, dance and spoken-word events to the park and various neighborhood venues each September. The Charlie Parker Jazz Festival is also held here, bringing some of the biggest jazz names to the ’hood each August.	90	-73.9819870107	40.7265191386	4.0	5	15	7	0	0	4.0	['32:00 - 41:00', '56:00 - 65:00', '80:00 - 89:00', '104:00 - 113:00', '128:00 - 137:00']	['Nature & Parks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	St Marks Place	One of the most magical things about New York is that every street tells a story, from the action unfurling before your eyes to the dense history hidden behind colorful facades. St Marks Place is one of the best strips of pavement in the city for story telling, as almost every building on these hallowed blocks is rife with tales from a time when the East Village embodied a far more lawless spirit. Technically St Marks Place is 8th St between Third Ave and Ave A; it earned its saintly moniker from the like-named church nearby on 10th St. Easily one of NYC’s most famous streets, St Marks Place is also one of the city’s smallest, occupying only three blocks between Astor Pl and Tompkins Square Park. The road, however, is jam-packed with historical tidbits that would delight any trivia buff. Some of the most important addresses include number 2, 4, 96 and 98, and 122 St Marks Place. Number 2 St Marks Place is known as the St Mark’s Ale House , but for a time it was the famous Five-Spot, where jazz fiend Thelonious Monk got his start in the 1950s. A cast of colorful characters have left their mark at 4 St Marks Place: Alexander Hamilton’s son built the structure, James Fenimore Cooper lived here in the 1830s and Yoko Ono’s Fluxus artists descended upon the building in the 1960s. The buildings at 96 and 98 St Marks Place are immortalized on the cover of Led Zepellin’s Physical Graffiti album. Though it closed in the 1990s, number 122 St Marks Place was the location of a popular cafe called Sin-é, where Jeff Buckley and David Gray often performed.		-73.986547	40.728137	4.5	22	11	4	0	0	4.5	[]	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Shopping']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Radio City Music Hall	A spectacular art deco diva, this 5901-seat movie palace was the brainchild of vaudeville producer Samuel Lionel 'Roxy' Rothafel. Never one for understatement, Roxy launched his venue on 23 December 1932 with an over-the-top extravaganza that included a Symphony of the Curtains (starring… you guessed it… the curtains), and the high-kick campness of precision dance troupe the Roxyettes (mercifully renamed the Rockettes),For a real treat, join a one-hour guided tour of the sumptuous interiors, designed by Donald Deskey. But first, eye-up the building's 50th St facade, where Hildreth Meière's whimsical brass rondels represent (from left to right) dance, drama and song. Celebrated artists also lavished the interiors.As far as catching a show here goes, be warned: the vibe doesn't quite match the theater's splendor now that it's managed by the folks from Madison Square Garden; latecomers are allowed, disrupting performances, and glow-in-the-dark cocktails often create an ugly sea of purple drinks that's more akin to a stadium rock concert than a sophisticated show in an elegant theater. Still, there are often some fabulous talents in the lineup, with past performers including Rufus Wainwright, Aretha Franklin and Dolly Parton. And while the word 'Rockettes' provokes eye rolling from most self-consciously cynical New Yorkers, fans of glitz and kitsch might just get a thrill from the troupe's annual Christmas Spectacular (your secret is safe with us… promise!).

usa	new-york-city	Washington Square Park	What was once a potter’s field and a square for public executions is now the unofficial town square of the Village, and plays host to lounging NYU students, fire-eating street performers, curious canines and their owners, and legions of speed-chess pros. Encased in perfectly manicured brownstones and gorgeous twists of modern architecture (all owned by NYU) Washington Square Park is one of the most beautiful garden spaces in the city – especially as you are welcomed by the iconic Stanford White Arch on the north side of the green.The arch, colloquially known as the Washington Square Arch, dominates the park with its 72ft of beaming white Dover marble. Originally designed in wood to celebrate the centennial of George Washington’s inauguration in 1889, the arch proved so popular that it was replaced with stone six years later and adorned with statues of the general in war and peace. In 1916 artist Marcel Duchamp famously climbed to the top of the arch by its internal stairway and declared the park the ‘Free and Independent Republic of Washington Square.’ Once it was clear that the park was here to stay, the public green became a haven for beatniks and political outcry, especially when urban planners sought to change the shape and usage of the space. Locals vehemently protested, and the square’s shape has remained largely unchanged since the 1800s.The political tradition continues even today, when Barack Obama led a rally here in 2007 to drum up support for his presidential bid. Turnout was, unsurprisingly, overwhelming.	90	-73.9981099936	40.7308630178	5.5	522	361	82	7	2	4.5	['33:00 - 41:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Statue of Liberty	In a city full of American icons, the Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most famous. Conceived as early as 1865 by French intellectual Edouard Laboulaye as a monument to the republican principals shared by France and the USA, it's still generally recognized as a symbol for at least the ideals of opportunity and freedom to many. French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi traveled to New York in 1871 to select the site, then spent more than 10 years in Paris designing and making the 151ft-tall figure Liberty Enlightening the World . It was then shipped to New York, erected on a small island in the harbor and unveiled in 1886. Structurally, it consists of an iron skeleton (designed by Gustave Eiffel) with a copper skin attached to it by stiff but flexible metal bars.The crown is again open to the public – numbers are limited, however, so reservations are required, as far in advance as possible. For those without crown reservations, a visit to Statue of Liberty National Monument means you can wander the grounds and enjoy the view from the 16-story observation deck; a specially designed glass ceiling lets you look up into the statue's striking interior. The trip to its island, via ferry, is usually visited in conjunction with nearby Ellis Island. Ferries leave from Battery Park. South Ferry and Bowling Green are the closest subway stations. Ferry tickets (additional $3 for crown admission) include admission to both sights and reservations can be made in advance.	210	-74.0449790821	40.6893735007	4.5	6372	3454	1136	224	99	4.5	['8:30 - 16:00', '32:30 - 40:00', '56:30 - 64:00', '80:30 - 88:00', '104:30 - 112:00', '128:30 - 136:00', '152:30 - 160:00']	['Monuments & Statues', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Williamsburg	Williamsburg is essentially a college town without a college – it's New York’s of-the-moment Bohemian magnet, drawing slouchy, baby-faced artists, musicians, writers and graphic designers. Once a bastion of Latino working-class life, it’s become a prominent dining and nightlife center – and, as a result, has attracted plenty of young urban professionals (and their attendant condo towers). It may not be full of major museums and picturesque architecture, but Williamsburg nonetheless offers plenty to do. The neighborhood now known as Williamsburg was once part of the greater community of Bushwick, a settlement founded by Dutch colonists in 1660. Williamsburg broke off into its own town in the 1820s, when the area began to industrialize. By the late 19th century, a steady stream of Jewish, German, Italian and Irish immigrants were arriving to fill factory jobs. By the 1920s, Puerto Rican immigrants began gaining a foothold. The area attracted textile manufacturers and beer brewers. One of the biggest companies in the area was Domino Sugar, which kept a plant on the East River until 2004. The factory (built in the late 19th century) is now a landmark and a favorite graffiti spot. Most of the neighborhood is located along the East River waterfront, to the north of the Williamsburg Bridge. Bedford Ave serves as the main drag, with clusters of side-by-side cafes, boutiques and restaurants tucked into the area between N 10th St and Metropolitan Ave.	90	-73.9591865561	40.7181200596	5.5	312	204	44	15	4	4.5	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Guggenheim Museum	A sculpture in its own right, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s building almost overshadows the collection of 20th century art it houses. Completed in 1959, the inverted ziggurat structure was derided by some critics, but it was hailed by others who welcomed it as a beloved architectural icon. Since it first opened, this unusual structure has appeared on countless postcards, TV programs and films. The Guggenheim came out of the collection of Solomon R Guggenheim, a New York mining magnate who began acquiring abstract art in his 60s at the behest of his art adviser, an eccentric German baroness named Hilla Rebay. The museum’s holdings include works by Kandinsky, Picasso and Jackson Pollock. Over time, other key additions have been made, including paintings by Monet, Van Gogh and Degas, photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, and key surrealist works donated by Guggenheim’s niece Peggy.The ascending ramp is occupied by rotating exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. Though Wright intended visitors to go to the top and wind their way down, the cramped, single elevator doesn’t allow for this. Exhibitions, therefore, are installed from bottom to top.There are two good on-site food options: Wright , at ground level, a space-age eatery serving steamy risotto and classic cocktails, and Cafe 3 , on the 3rd floor, which offers sparkling views of Central Park and excellent coffee and light snacks.	120	-73.9588236497	40.783095828	3.5	898	699	528	339	264	3.5	['10:00 - 17:45', '34:00 - 41:45', '58:00 - 65:45', '82:00 - 89:45', '130:00 - 137:45', '154:00 - 163:45']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	National Museum of the American Indian	An affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, this elegant museum of Native American culture is set in Cass Gilbert's spectacular 1907 Custom House, one of NYC's finest beaux arts buildings. Beyond a vast elliptical rotunda, sleek galleries play host to changing exhibitions documenting Native American art, culture, life and beliefs. The museum's permanent collection includes stunning decorative arts, textiles and ceremonial objects that document the diverse native cultures across the Americas.It’s an ironically grand space for the country’s leading museum on Native American art, established by oil heir George Gustav Heye in 1916. The four giant female sculptures outside the building are the work of Daniel Chester French, who would go on to sculpt the seated Abraham Lincoln at Washington, DC's Lincoln Memorial. Representing (from left to right) Asia, North America, Europe and Africa, the figures offer a revealing look at America's world view at the beginning of the 20th century; Asia 'bound' by its religions, America 'youthful and virile,' Europe 'wise yet decaying' and Africa 'asleep and barbaric.' The museum also hosts a range of cultural programs, including dance and music performances, readings for children, craft demonstrations, films and workshops. The museum shop is well-stocked with Native American jewelry, books, CDs and crafts.	90	-74.0138554957	40.7044086231	5.0	123	131	42	13	5	4.0	['106:00 - 116:00', '10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Whitney Museum of American Art	The Whitney makes no secret of its mission to provoke, which starts with its imposing Brutalist building, a structure that houses works by 20th century masters Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Georgia O’Keeffe and Mark Rothko. In addition to rotating exhibits, there is a biennial on even years, an ambitious survey of contemporary art that rarely fails to generate controversy.The museum was opened in 1931 by society doyenne Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who was known for her lively Greenwich Village salons. During her lifetime, she collected more than 600 works of art, including canvases by painters such as Thomas Hart Benton and George Bellows. These works comprise the core of the museum’s permanent collection, which is displayed on the 5th floor.After inhabiting various locations downtown, the Whitney moved to its current Marcel Breuer–designed building in 1966. But, having outgrown these digs, it is set to move again. A new Renzo Piano–designed structure in the Meatpacking District was nearing completion as this book went to press. Located right next to the High Line (at Washington and Gansevoort Sts), the 200,000-square-foot space will open in 2015.For food, try the museum's Danny Meyer comfort eatery in the basement, Untitled . Cedar plank salmon, gourmet burgers, smoked trout sandwiches and all-day breakfast are among the hits.	90	-73.9638007783	40.7733447127	5.5	420	196	66	32	20	4.5	['10:30 - 18:00', '34:30 - 42:00', '82:30 - 90:00', '106:30 - 118:00', '130:30 - 142:00', '154:30 - 166:00']	['Literary, Art & Music Tours', 'Art Museums', 'Tours & Activities', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Fraunces Tavern Museum	Combining five early-18th-century structures, this unique museum/restaurant/bar combo pays homage to the nation-shaping events of 1783, when the British relinquished control of New York at the end of the Revolutionary War, and General George Washington gave a farewell speech to the officers of the Continental Army in the 2nd-floor dining room on December 4.The site was originally built as a tony residence for merchant Stephen Delancey’s family; barkeeper Samuel Fraunces purchased it in 1762, turning it into a tavern in honor of the American victory in the Revolutionary War. After the war, when New York was the nation’s first capital, the space was used by the Departments of War, Treasury and Foreign Affairs. The tavern was closed and fell into disuse in the 19th century – and soon after was damaged during several massive fires that destroyed most colonial buildings and Dutch-built structures in the area. In 1904, the Sons of the Revolution, a historical society, bought the building and returned it to an approximation of its colonial-era look – an act believed to be the first major attempt at historical preservation in the USA. Today, the museum hosts lectures, Revolutionary War paintings, occasional historical walking tours, and some surprising Washington relics, including a lock of hair and a fragment from his coffin.	120	-74.01126827	40.70339405	5.5	42	25	11	2	0	4.5	['24:00 - 41:00', '48:00 - 65:00', '72:00 - 89:00', '96:00 - 113:00', '120:00 - 137:00', '144:00 - 161:00', '168:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 17:00']	['History Museums', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	New York University	In 1831 Albert Gallatin, formerly Secretary of the Treasury under President Thomas Jefferson, founded an intimate center of higher learning open to all students, regardless of race or class background. He’d scarcely recognize the place today, as it’s swelled to a student population of more than 54,000, with more than 16,000 employees, and schools and colleges at six Manhattan locations. It just keeps growing, too – to the dismay of landmark activists and business owners, who have seen buildings rapidly bought out by the academic giant (or destroyed through careless planning, such as with the historic Province­town Playhouse) and replaced with ugly dormitories or administrative offices. Still, some of its crevices are charming, such as the leafy courtyard at its School of Law, or impressively modern, like the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, where top-notch dance, theater, music, spoken-word and other performers wow audiences at the 850-seat theater. NYU’s academic offerings are highly regarded and wide-ranging, especially its film, theater, writing, medical and law programs. For a unique experience that will put you on the fast track to meeting locals, sign up for a weekend or one-day class – from American history to photography – offered by the School of Professional Studies and Continuing Education, and open to all.	90	-73.9958777837	40.7296302637	4.0	14	14	7	1	0	4.0	[]	['Educational sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Lower East Side Art Galleries	Though Chelsea may be the heavy hitter when it comes to the New York art gallery scene, the LES has its very own collection of about a dozen quality showplaces, thank you very much. Some have actually relocated here from Chelsea in recent years, and all are now anchored by the New Museum (235 Bowery). Participant Inc, showcasing emerging talent and hosting varied performances, was one of the places hailed as jump-­starting the gallery trend here when it opened several years ago. Other popular, contemporary spaces include Gallery Onetwentyeight, Reena Spaulings Fine Art, Lehmann Maupin and the new Angel Orensanz Foundation, housed in a soaring, gorgeous former synagogue that also hosts a slew of special events. But the biggest news of late is that of the new Sperone Westwater gallery, relocated from the West Village to the Bowery, right near the New Museum, in what was promising to be, at the time of writing, a startling, eight-story sliver sheathed in milled glass, with bright-red elevator doors and entire exhibits visible from out on the street. The gallery represents heavy hitters like William Wegman and Richard Long, and its new home is being designed by the famed Norman Foster, who’s already made a big impact on NYC with the Hearst Building and his plans for the new Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.	120	None	None	3.5	25	43	22	17	17	3.5	['83:00 - 90:00', '107:00 - 117:00', '11:00 - 18:00', '131:00 - 138:00', '155:00 - 162:00']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Chelsea Hotel	It’s probably not any great shakes as far as hotels go – and besides, it mainly houses long-term residents – but as a place of mythical proportions, the Chelsea Hotel is top of the line. The red-brick hotel, featuring ornate iron balconies and no fewer than seven plaques declaring its literary landmark status, has played a major role in pop-culture history.It’s where the likes of Mark Twain, Thomas Wolfe, Dylan Thomas and Arthur Miller hung out; Jack Kerouac allegedly crafted On the Road during one marathon session here, and it’s where Arthur C Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey . Dylan Thomas died of alcohol poisoning while staying here in 1953, and Nancy Spungen died here after being stabbed by her Sex Pistols boyfriend Sid Vicious in 1978. Among the many celebs who have logged time living at the Chelsea are Joni Mitchell, Stanley Kubrick, Dennis Hopper, Edith Piaf, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, whose song ‘Chelsea Hotel’ recalls a romp with Janis Joplin (who spent time here, too).Big changes are underway at the Chelsea. In 2011, the hotel was sold to a luxury developer and closed for renovations. Long-term residents however remained – largely because it was illegal to evict them. The property was then resold in 2013 to yet another luxury developer, and the future of the building remains uncertain.	90	-73.99676344	40.74435066	5.5	126	109	22	4	1	4.5	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Chrysler Building	The 77-floor Chrysler Building makes most other skyscrapers look like uptight geeks. Designed by Willian Van Alen in 1930, it's a dramatic fusion of art deco and Gothic aesthetics, adorned with stern steel eagles and topped by a spire that screams Bride of Frankenstein. The building was constructed as the headquarters for Walter P Chrysler and his automobile empire. Unable to compete on the production line with bigger rivals Ford and General Motors, Chrysler decided to trump them on the skyline. More than 80 years on, Chrysler's ambitious $15 million statement remains one of New York's most poignant symbols.Although the Chrysler Building has no restaurant or observation deck, its lobby is a lavish consolation prize.For a great view of the Chrysler Building, head to the corner of Third Ave and 44th St, from where you can appreciate the building's slimline profile, gargoyles and spire in one hit. If you have binoculars, bring them for a close-up view of the facade's detailing, which includes basket-weave motifs and a band of abstract automobiles. Alternatively, head to the top of the Chrysler Building's taller rival, the Empire State Building, where pay-per-view telescopes will get you up close and personal with that gleaming steel spire.	90	-73.975464	40.751443	5.5	508	276	62	7	1	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge	Extending from near JFK, airport at the start of the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, the salty, marshy Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is one of the most important migratory bird and wetland habitats along the eastern seaboard. In spring and fall, more than 325 bird species stop in to rest and snack, snapping up all sorts of briny sea creatures like clams, turtles, shrimp and oysters. Each season brings different visitors: spring features warblers and songbirds, and American woodcocks in late March. In mid-August shorebirds start to move south, landing here from Canada, fueling up for the trip to Mexico. Fall is when migrating hawks and raptors get mobile, along with ducks, geese, monarch butterflies and thousands and thousands of dragonflies. Birders and naturalists get the most action around the east and west ponds; they’re both about 1.5 miles in circumference and easily walkable, but wear mudresistant shoes, bug repellent and sunscreen, carry some water and watch out for poison ivy. o get to the visitors center, exit at Broad Channel station, walk along Noel Rd to Crossbay Blvd, turn right (north) and walk for about half a mile, and the center will be visible on the left side of the road.	90	-73.83443935	40.619882	4.5	10	4	2	0	0	4.5	['8:30 - 17:00', '32:30 - 41:00', '56:30 - 65:00', '80:30 - 89:00', '104:30 - 113:00', '128:30 - 137:00', '152:30 - 161:00']	['Nature & Parks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Roosevelt Island	Not exactly part of the Upper East Side but floating in the East River between Manhattan’s eastern edge and Queens, New York’s anomalous, planned neighborhood sits on a tiny island no wider than a football field. It was once known as Blackwell’s Island after the farming family who lived here; the city bought the island in 1828 and constructed several public hospitals and a mental hospital. In the 1970s, New York State built housing for 10,000 people along Roosevelt Island’s Main St (the only street on the island). The planned area along the cobblestone roadway resembles an Olympic village or, as some observe more cynically, cookie-cutter college housing.Zipping across the river via the four-minute aerial tram is a trip in itself and worth it for the stunning view of the East Side of Manhattan framed by the 59th St Bridge. Instead of heading straight back like most do, however, bring a picnic or a bike, as this quiet island is conducive to lounging and cycling. Trams leave from the Roosevelt Island tramway station every 15 minutes on the quarter-hour from 6am to 2am Sunday to Thursday, and until 3:30am Friday and Saturday; the one-way fare is $2.

usa	new-york-city	Grand Central Terminal	Completed in 1913, Grand Central Terminal – more commonly, if technically incorrectly, called Grand Central Station – is another of New York’s stunning Beaux Arts buildings, boasting 75ft-high, glass-encased catwalks and a vaulted ceiling bearing a mural of the constellations streaming across it – backwards (the designer must’ve been dyslexic). The balconies overlooking the main concourse afford an expansive view; perch yourself on one of these at around 5pm on a weekday to get a glimpse of the grace that this terminal commands under pressure. It’s quite amazing how this dramatic space evokes the romance of train travel at the turn of the 20th century while also enduring the bustle of present-day New York. There are no teary good-byes for people traveling across the country from here today, though, as Grand Central’s underground electric tracks serve only commuter trains en route to northern suburbs and Connecticut. But whether you’re traveling somewhere or not, the station merits a special trip for the architecture alone – not to mention for the fine-dining restaurants and gourmet food court, cool bars, funky shops, holiday craft fairs and occasional music performances.	90	-73.97717442	40.75298929	4.5	7480	3791	539	43	12	4.5	['5:30 - 26:00', '29:30 - 50:00', '53:30 - 74:00', '77:30 - 98:00', '101:30 - 122:00', '125:30 - 146:00', '149:30 - 168:00', '0:00 - 2:00']	['Mass Transportation Systems', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Transportation', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

usa	new-york-city	Coney Island	Coney Island was a working-class resort area at the turn of the 20th century. Though it is no longer the booming, peninsula-wide attraction it was then, it has blossomed in recent years with new crowds, fresh rides and plentiful places to eat and drink. The area traces its amusement park roots to the mid-1800s, when inhabitants of the increasingly industrialized city began to seek relief from their sweltering tenements in summer. By the late 19th century, the area was a rough and tumble party spot dubbed ‘Sodom by the Sea.’ In the early 1900s, however, family amusements began to materialize. The most famous, Luna Park, opened in 1903 – a dream world with live camels and elephants, illuminated by more than a million bulbs. Today, it is still possible to ride the Wonder Wheel (opened in 1920) and the clackety Cyclone roller coaster (1927). The area was a bit of a ghost town in the ’80s, but it has experienced a resurgence in recent years, drawing New Yorkers who come to chow on hot dogs, catch a sideshow, and dress up like punk mermaids at the annual Mermaid Parade.

usa	new-york-city	Morris-Jumel Mansion Museum	Built in 1765 as a country retreat for Roger and Mary Morris, this columned mansion is the oldest house in Manhattan. It is also famous for having served as George Washington’s headquarters after it was seized by the Continental Army in 1776. The mansion’s rooms contain many original furnishings, including a bed that reputedly belonged to Napoleon.Across the street, along 10-18 Jumel Terrace , stands a row of townhouses, designed in the 1890s by the renowned architect Henri Fouchaux. At number 16 lived prolific entertainer and civil-rights activist Paul Robeson, who subsequently moved to 555 Edgecombe Ave .Around the corner lies storybook Sylvan Terrace , still graced by its original, late 19th-century gas lamps. The street's striking wooden houses – resplendent with their high narrow stoops, dentiled canopies and boldly paneled wooden doors – was NYC's first attempt at building affordable abodes for city workers. Equally unique are the street's cobbled stones, which, unlike those of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, are Belgian, not Dutch.	120	-73.938653	40.834325	4.0	12	19	7	0	0	4.0	['10:00 - 16:00', '82:00 - 88:00', '106:00 - 112:00', '130:00 - 136:00', '154:00 - 160:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Bryant Park	European coffee kiosks, alfresco chess games, summer film screenings and winter ice-skating: it's hard to believe that this leafy oasis was dubbed 'Needle Park’ in the ’80s. Nestled behind the show-stopping New York Public Library building, it's a whimsical spot for a little time-out from the Midtown madness.Among the park's attractions is the French-inspired, Brooklyn-made Le Carrousel offering rides, as well as frequent special events. These include the Bryant Park Summer Film Festival, popular with post-work crowds lugging cheese-and-wine picnics. Come Christmastime, the place becomes a winter wonderland, with holiday gift vendors lining the park’s edge and a popular ice-skating rink sprouting in its middle. Lovely Bryant Park Grill is the site of many a New York wedding come springtime, and when it’s not closed for a private event, the patio bar is a perfect spot for a twilight cocktail. Next door you'll find its more casual alfresco sibling Bryant Park Café , a much-loved spot for after-5 catch-ups.	150	-73.9834330674	40.7535144227	5.5	4290	2154	298	22	10	4.5	['7:00 - 22:00', '31:00 - 46:00', '55:00 - 70:00', '79:00 - 94:00', '103:00 - 118:00', '127:00 - 142:00', '151:00 - 166:00']	['Sports Complexes', 'Nature & Parks', 'Fun & Games']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Trinity Church	New York City's tallest building upon completion in 1846, Trinity Church features a 280ft-high bell tower, an arresting stained glass window over the altar, and a small museum of historical church artifacts. Famous residents of its serene cemetery include Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, while its excellent music series includes Concerts at One (1pm Thursdays) and magnificent choir concerts, including an annual December rendition of Handel’s Messiah .The original Anglican parish church was founded by King William III in 1697 and once presided over several constituent chapels, including St Paul’s Chapel at the corner of Fulton St and Broadway. Its huge landholdings in Lower Manhattan made it the country’s wealthiest and most influential church throughout the 18th century. Burnt down in 1776, its second incarnation was demolished in 1839. The third and current church, designed by English architect Richard Upjohn, helped launch the picturesque neo-Gothic movement in America.	90	-74.0121352644	40.7080483372	5.5	224	209	38	4	1	4.5	[]	['Religious Sites', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Little Italy	Unlike Chinatown, which feels as though it’s bursting at the seams, Little Italy has been steadily shrinking over the last 50 years. The once strong Italian neighborhood (film director Martin Scorsese grew up on Elizabeth St) saw an exodus in the mid-20th century when many of its residents moved to more suburban neighborhoods in Brooklyn and beyond. Still, loyal Italian Americans flock here to gather around red-and-white-checked tablecloths for heaping pasta and pizza portions. If you’re in town in late September, be sure to check out the raucous San Gennaro Festival, which honors the patron saint of Naples. New York’s tribute to the Boot-land is mostly concentrated on Mulberry St between Broome and Canal Sts. Here you’ll find scores of restaurants with their signature checkerboard tablecloths spooning out bowlfuls of homemade pasta and spinning hot tin trays of Neapolitan slices. It’s got a pick-a-table-and-enjoy kinda vibe, so put down the guidebook and enjoy the dolce vita. 	90	-73.997651	40.718575	4.0	519	564	404	145	69	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	new-york-city	Top of the Rock	This open-air observation deck at the top of Rockefeller Center first wowed New Yorkers back in 1933. Designed in homage to ocean liners popular in the day, it was an incredible place – 70 stories above Midtown – from which to view the city. But it became off-limits for almost two decades starting in 1986, when renovation of the stunning Rainbow Room restaurant five floors below cut off access to the roof. The observation deck was reopened with much fanfare in 2005, and since then it’s been proving to be an even better bet than the Empire State Building: it’s much less crowded and has wider observation decks that span several levels – some are indoors, some are outside with Plexiglass walls and those at the very top are completely alfresco. Though the Chrysler Building is partially obscured, you do get an excellent view of the Empire State Building, as well as Central Park’s perfect patch of green. The very cool, multimedia-enhanced elevator ride to the top is an exciting bonus.	90	-73.9795244	40.75908896	5.5	24136	7109	1165	185	94	4.5	['8:00 - 23:00', '32:00 - 47:00', '56:00 - 71:00', '80:00 - 95:00', '104:00 - 119:00', '128:00 - 143:00', '152:00 - 167:00']	['Observation Decks & Towers', 'Lookouts', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	new-york-city	Lower East Side Tenement Museum	This museum puts the neighborhood’s heartbreaking but inspiring heritage on full display in three recreations of turn-of-the-20th-century tenements, including the late-19th-century home and garment shop of the Levine family from Poland, and two immigrant dwellings from the Great Depressions of 1873 and 1929. The visitor center shows a video detailing the difficult life endured by the people who once lived in the surrounding buildings, which more often than not had no running water or electricity. Museum visits are available only as part of scheduled tours (the price of which is included in the admission), which typically operate daily. But call ahead or check the website for the schedules, as they change frequently. The museum also leads various other tours, from one that explores various Lower East Side sites and their role in the neighborhood’s immigration history to another that visits the restored home of Irish immigrants who dealt with the death of a child in the 1800s.	90	-73.989959	40.718737	5.5	2423	681	173	68	28	4.5	['106:00 - 116:30', '10:00 - 18:30', '34:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 66:30', '82:00 - 90:30', '130:00 - 138:30', '154:00 - 162:30']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity

Founded by the English in 1685, the 1.5-mile-long fishing community juts into the Long Island Sound and Eastchester Bay, connected to the mainland by a causeway. The Victorian clapboard houses here definitely look more New England than the Bronx, and the island is filled with boat slips, half a dozen yacht clubs and some rowdy seafood restaurants – notably Tony’s Pier (1 City Island Ave), which fries everything but the cocktails. If you’re serious about diving, sailing or fishing, head to City Island. Island Current leads fishing tours all year (from $65) and sunset tours. Captain Mike’s Dive Shop (530 City Island Ave) offers two-tank dive trips in the Long Island Sound or the ocean from May through November (from $90).

The prime draw for shoppers, though, are the more than two dozen food shops, including Amy’s Bread, Fat Witch Bakery, the Lobster Place, Hale & Hearty Soup, Ronnybrook Dairy and the Nutbox. You can also sit down and indulge at lunch spots such as the Green Table organic-food cafe, and buy nonfood items at Imports from Marrakesh (specializing in Moroccan art and design) and the expert-staffed Chelsea Wine Vault.

usa	new-york-city	Federal Hall	A Greek Revival masterpiece, Federal Hall houses a museum dedicated to postcolonial New York. Themes include George Washington’s inauguration, Alexander Hamilton’s relationship with the city, and the struggles of John Peter Zenger – jailed, tried and acquitted of libel here for exposing government corruption in his newspaper. There's also a visitor information hall which covers downtown cultural happenings.Distinguished by a huge statue of George Washington, the building itself stands on the site of New York’s original City Hall. It was here that the first US Congress convened and that Washington took the oath of office as the first US president on April 30, 1789. The museum's artifacts include the very slab of stone on which Washington stood while taking that oath. After that structure’s demolition in the early 19th century, the current building rose in its place between 1834 and 1842, serving as the US Customs House until 1862.	90	-74.010254989	40.7071774805	4.0	39	62	32	4	0	4.0	['33:00 - 41:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Later, and before Ellis Island opened to immigrants, Castle Garden (as it was then known) served as the major processing center for new immigrant arrivals, welcoming more than eight million people between 1855 and 1890. Rangers lead historic tours of the site daily at 10am, noon and 2pm, subject to staff availability.	90	-74.01682522	40.70354466	3.0	3	15	22	9	0	3.0	['8:00 - 17:00', '32:00 - 41:00', '56:00 - 65:00', '80:00 - 89:00', '104:00 - 113:00', '128:00 - 137:00', '152:00 - 161:00']	['Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

usa	new-york-city	Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church	Treating Harlem Sunday services, which are mostly Baptist, like a theatrical tourist event is a bit of an odd pastime. Still, the music is electrifying, and folks with any desire to feel immersed in such soulfulness will have a hard time staying away. Just behave respectfully and logically – no photos of worshipers in action, for example – and the experience should be a great one. An old saying says that in Harlem ‘there’s a bar on every corner and a church on every block.’ Sunday services usually start at 11am. The Abyssinian Baptist Church (132 Odell Clark Pl (138th St) btwn Adam Clayton Powell Jr & Malcolm X Blvds) is quite welcoming to outsiders, as is the Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church , around the corner, which usually takes the overflow from the Abyssinian.	90	-73.94154434	40.81592867	4.0	5	9	3	1	0	4.0	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

usa	new-york-city	Brooklyn Museum	This encyclopedic museum is housed in a five-story, 560,000-sq-ft beaux arts building designed by McKim, Mead & White. Construction on the building began in the early 1890s (when Brooklyn was still independent) and the intention had been to make it the largest single-site museum in the world. But the plan lost steam in 1898, when Brooklyn was incorporated into New York. Today, the building houses more than 1.5 million objects, including ancient artifacts, 19th century period rooms, and sculptures and painting from across several centuries. The museum offers a great alternative to the packed-to-the-gills institutions in Manhattan. And the modern plaza out front is a good place to hang out when it’s sunny.Admission is free on the first Saturday of every month after 5pm.	120	-73.9639708	40.67159345	5.5	418	187	44	6	1	4.5	['83:00 - 90:00', '107:00 - 118:00', '11:00 - 18:00', '131:00 - 138:00', '155:00 - 162:00']	['Natural History Museums', 'Art Museums', 'Museums']	True	activity
