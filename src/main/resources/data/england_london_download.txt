Chinese Pagoda	england	london	activity	This 49.5m-tall eight-sided pagoda (1762), designed by William Chambers (who designed Somerset House), is one of the Kew Gardens' architectural icons. During WWII, the pagoda withstood the blast from a stick of Luftwaffe bombs exploding nearby, and was also secretly employed by the Ministry of Defence to test bomb trajectories (which involved cutting holes in each floor). Current restorations – due to be completed in 2018 - will return its former full colours, along with the 80 dragons that once decorated the pagoda.	The original wooden dragons vanished in the 1780s, never to return.		[]			True	False			['Notable Building']	[]	-0.2947	51.470745			[]	Kew Gardens		False			[]
London Wetland Centre	england	london	activity	One of Europe’s largest inland wetland projects, this 43-hectare centre run by the Wildfowl  Wetlands Trust was transformed from four Victorian reservoirs in 2000 and attracts some 140 species of bird, as well as frogs, butterflies, dragonflies and lizards, plus a thriving colony of watervoles. The glass-fronted observatory affords panoramic views over the lakes, while meandering paths and boardwalks lead visitors through the watery habitats of black swans, Bewick's swans, geese, red-crested pochards, sand martins, coots, bitterns, herons and kingfishers.	 Don’t miss the Peacock Tower, a three-storey hide – and magnet for serious birders – on the main lake’s eastern edge; other hides are sprinkled around the reserve, including the Headley Discovery Hide in the west. The wetland is also well-populated with eight different species of bats that feed on the abundant moths. A short walk north of the entrance, the wetland's family of sleek-coated otters are fed daily at 11am and 2pm. Free daily tours , which are led by knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff members, are highly recommended. They depart at 11.30am and 2.30pm daily. Binoculars can be hired from the shop.	9.30am-6pm Apr-Oct, to 5pm Nov-Mar	[]		http://www.wwt.org.uk	True	False	90	adult/child/family £12.75/7/35.55	['Wildlife Reserve']	['Nature & Wildlife Areas', 'Nature & Parks']	-0.230741713	51.478738185	6.5	4.5	['248', '112', '27', '11', '4']	Queen Elizabeth's Walk	London Wetland Centre Queen Elizabeth Walk, , London, SW13 9WT	True	147		[]

Whitechapel Road	england	london	activity	The East End’s main thoroughfare hums with a constant cacophony of Asian, African, European and Middle Eastern languages, its busy shops and market stalls selling everything from Indian snacks to Nigerian fabrics and Turkish jewellery, as the area’s multitudinous ethnic groupings rub up against each other more or less comfortably. It’s a chaotic and poor place, but it’s full of life.	Within a few minutes’ walk of Whitechapel tube station you’ll pass the enormous East London Mosque and, directly behind it, the now defunct Fieldgate St Great Synagogue, built in 1899. Further down Fieldgate St, oversized Tower House was once a hostel and then a dosshouse, but is now a redeveloped apartment block. Past residents include Joseph Stalin and authors Jack London and George Orwell. The latter described it in detail in Down and Out in Paris and London (1933).Whitechurch Rd morphs into Mile End Rd at the intersection with Cambridge Heath Rd, but just before it does you'll find the Blind Beggar. William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, preached his first sermon outside this pub in 1865; there's a statue to his memory near the beginning of Mile End Rd. The pub is also famous as the place where notorious gangster Ronnie Kray shot and killed George Cornell in 1966 during a turf war over control of the East End’s organised crime. He was jailed for life and died in 1995.It's worth strolling 150m along Mile End Rd to take a look at the Trinity Green Almshouses. Built for injured or retired sailors in 1695, the two rows of almshouses run at right angles away from the street, facing a lawn and a central chapel with a clock tower.

St Paul's Cathedral	england	london	activity	Towering over Ludgate Hill, in a superb position that's been a place of Christian worship for over 1400 years, St Paul’s Cathedral is one of London’s most majestic and iconic buildings. For Londoners, the vast dome, which still manages to dominate the skyline, is a symbol of resilience and pride, standing tall for more than 300 years. Viewing Sir Christopher Wren’s masterpiece from the inside and climbing to the top for sweeping views of the capital is an exhilarating experience.	The cathedral was designed by Wren after the Great Fire and built between 1675 and 1710; it opened the following year. The site is ancient hallowed ground, with four other cathedrals preceding Wren's English baroque masterpiece here, the first dating from 604.The dome, the world's second-largest cathedral dome and weighing in at 65,000 tons, is famed for sidestepping Luftwaffe incendiary bombs in the 'Second Great Fire of London' of December 1940, becoming an icon of London resilience during the Blitz. Outside the cathedral, to the north, a monument to the people of London is a simple and elegant memorial to the 32,000 Londoners killed.Inside, some 30m above the main paved area, is the first of three domes (actually a dome inside a cone inside a dome) supported by eight huge columns. The walkway around its base, 257 steps up a staircase on the western side of the southern transept, is called the Whispering Gallery, because if you talk close to the wall, your words will carry to the opposite side, 32m away. A further 119 steps brings you to the Stone Gallery, 152 iron steps above which is the Golden Gallery at the very top, rewarded with unforgettable views of London. As part of its 300th anniversary celebrations in 2011, St Paul's underwent a £40-million renovation project that gave the church a deep clean. It's not looked this good since they cut the blue ribbon opening the cathedral in 1711.The crypt has memorials to up to 300 heroes and military demigods, including Wellington and Nelson, whose body lies directly below the dome. But the most poignant memorial is to Wren himself. On a simple slab bearing his name, part of a Latin inscription translates as: 'If you seek his memorial, look around you'. Also here is the Crypt Café and the excellent Restaurant at St Paul's.Free multimedia tours lasting 1½ hours are available. Free 1½-hour guided tours leave the tour desk four times a day (typically at 10am, 11am, 1pm and 2pm); head to the desk just past the entrance to check times and book a place. Around twice a month, 60-minute tours (£8) also visit the astonishing Library, the Geometric Staircase and Great Model, and include impressive views down the nave from above the Great West Doors; check the website for dates and hours and book well ahead. Filming and photography is not permitted within the cathedral.	8.30am-4.30pm Mon-Sat	['32:30 - 40:30', '56:30 - 64:30', '80:30 - 88:30', '104:30 - 112:30', '128:30 - 136:30', '152:30 - 160:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/c72bd1bce5209319f28f78e904644cb5-st-paul-s-cathedral.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.stpauls.co.uk	True	False	90	adult/child £18/8	['Cathedral']	['Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.0983153304302	51.513764774	6.5	4.5	['4098', '1459', '346', '137', '93']	St Paul's Churchyard		True	27	90	[]
Shakespeare's Globe	england	london	activity	Unlike other venues for Shakespearean plays, the new Globe was designed to resemble the original as closely as possible, which means having the arena open to the fickle London skies, leaving the 700 ‘groundlings’ to stand in London’s spectacular downpours. Visits to the Globe include tours of the theatre (half-hourly, generally in the morning from 9.30am, with afternoon tours on Monday too) as well as access to the exhibition space, which has fascinating exhibits about Shakespeare and theatre in the 17th century.	Despite the worldwide popularity of Shakespeare over the centuries, the Globe was almost a distant memory when American actor (and, later, film director) Sam Wanamaker came searching for it in 1949. Undeterred by the fact that the theatre’s foundations had vanished beneath a row of heritage-listed Georgian houses, Wanamaker set up the Globe Playhouse Trust in 1970 and began fundraising for a memorial theatre. Work started only 200m from the original Globe site in 1987, but Wanamaker died four years before it opened in 1997.The Globe was painstakingly constructed using 600 oak pegs (nary a nail or a screw in the house), specially fired Tudor bricks and thatching reeds from Norfolk that apparently evoke displeasure in pigeons. Even the plaster contains goat hair, lime and sand, as it did in the Bard's day.The Globe also opened the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2014, an indoor Jacobean theatre. Shakespeare wrote for both outdoor and indoor theatre and the playhouse had always been part of the Globe's ambitions. The Playhouse is sometimes visited on tours instead of the Globe, depending on rehearsals and performances.	9am-5pm	['10:00 - 17:30', '34:00 - 41:30', '58:00 - 65:30', '82:00 - 89:30', '106:00 - 113:30', '130:00 - 137:30', '154:00 - 161:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/1e9d52b72d101453e03d0d19c9da408e-shakespeare-s-globe.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.shakespearesglobe.com	True	False	90	adult/child £14/8	['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Concerts & Shows', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.0970441496509	51.5081017114	6.5	4.5	['3137', '1089', '213', '73', '48']	21 New Globe Walk	21 New Globe Walk, , London, SE1 9DT	True	35		[]
Big Ben	england	london	activity	The most famous feature of the Houses of Parliament is Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben.

National Gallery	england	london	activity	With some 2300 European paintings on display, this is one of the world's great art collections, with seminal works from every important epoch in the history of art – from the mid-13th to the early 20th century, including masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Van Gogh and Renoir.Many visitors flock to the East Wing (1700–1900), where works by 18th-century British artists such as Gainsborough, Constable and Turner, and seminal Impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces by Van Gogh, Renoir and Monet await.	The modern Sainsbury Wing on the gallery’s western side houses paintings from 1250 to 1500. Here you will find largely religious paintings commissioned for private devotion (eg the Wilton Diptych) as well more unusual masterpieces such as Botticelli’s Venus and Mars and Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait. Leonardo Da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks, in room 57, is a stunning masterpiece.Works from the High Renaissance (1500–1600) embellish the West Wing where Michelangelo, Titian, Raphael, Correggio, El Greco and Bronzino hold court; Rubens, Rembrandt and Caravaggio grace the North Wing (1600–1700). Notable are two self-portraits of Rembrandt (age 34 and 63) and the beautiful Rokeby Venus by Velázquez.The comprehensive audio guides (£4) are highly recommended, as are the free one-hour taster tours that leave from the information desk in the Sainsbury Wing daily at 11.30am and 2.30pm, with late tours at 7pm Friday. There are also special trails and activity sheets for children.Don't overlook the astonishing floor mosaics in the main vestibule inside the entrance to the National Gallery.The National Dining Rooms provide high-quality British food, an all-day bakery and splendid afternoon teas.If you want to get sketching, bring your own stool and hand-held pad along and select your artwork. Occasional music performances are held in the National Gallery; check the website for details.The National Gallery is only shut for four days a year – from 24–26 December and on New Year's Day.	10am-6pm Sat-Thu, to 9pm Fri	['130:00 - 141:00', '10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/077df6be3c6dc1b81b9ccacc8bff730f-national-gallery.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk	True	True	90		['Gallery']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-0.128305283	51.508581929	6.5	4.5	['10490', '3121', '604', '127', '67']	Trafalgar Sq	Trafalgar Square, , London, WC2N 5DN	False	2	90	[]
National Portrait Gallery	england	london	activity	What makes the National Portrait Gallery so compelling is its familiarity; in many cases you’ll have heard of the subject (royals, scientists, politicians, celebrities) or the artist (Andy Warhol, Annie Leibovitz, Lucian Freud). Highlights include the famous ‘Chandos portrait’ of William Shakespeare, the first artwork the gallery acquired (in 1856) and believed to be the only likeness made during the playwright’s lifetime, and a touching sketch of novelist Jane Austen by her sister.	A further highlight is the ‘Ditchley’ portrait of Queen Elizabeth I displaying her might by standing on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire. The collection is organised chronologically (starting with the early Tudors on the 2nd floor), and then by theme. The 1st-floor portraits illustrate the rise and fall of the British Empire through the Victorian era and the 20th century. Don’t miss the high-kitsch statue of Victoria and Albert in Anglo-Saxon dress in room 21.The ground floor is dedicated to modern figures, using a variety of media (sculpture, photography, video etc). Among the most popular are the iconic Blur portraits by Julian Opie and Sam Taylor-Johnson's (Sam Taylor-Wood) David, a (low-res by today's standards) video-portrait of David Beckham asleep after football training. Don't miss Self by Mark Quinn, a frozen, refrigerated sculpture of the artist's head, made from 4.5L of his own blood and recast every five years. The excellent audio guide (single £3, family £6, free for disabled visitors) highlights more than 300 portraits and allows you to hear the voices of some of the subjects and artists.The Portrait restaurant does wonderful food and has superb views towards Westminster.	10am-6pm Sat-Wed, to 9pm Thu & Fri	['106:00 - 117:00', '130:00 - 141:00', '10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.npg.org.uk	True	False	150		['Gallery']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-0.127748	51.50933	6.5	4.5	['2266', '937', '189', '29', '18']	St Martin's Pl	2 St. Martin's Place, , London, WC2H 0HE	True	39	150	[]
Hyde Park	england	london	activity	At 145 hectares, Hyde Park is central London's largest open space, expropriated from the Church in 1536 by Henry VIII and turned into a hunting ground and later a venue for duels, executions and horse racing. The 1851 Great Exhibition was held here, and during WWII the park became an enormous potato field. These days, there's boating on the Serpentine, summer concerts (Bruce Springsteen, Florence + The Machine, Patti Smith), film nights and other warm-weather events.	During winter, the southeast area of the park is the site of Winter Wonderland (www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com), with fairground rides, ice skating and other seasonal attractions.The Holocaust Memorial Garden is a simple but evocative memorial to the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime.While Speakers' Corner is intended for oratorical acrobats, these days it's largely eccentrics and religious fanatics who address bemused onlookers, maintaining a tradition begun in 1872 as a response to rioting. Nearby Marble Arch, designed by John Nash in 1828 as the entrance to Buckingham Palace, was moved here in 1851. The infamous Tyburn Tree, a three-legged gallows, once stood close by and was the place of execution for up to 50,000 people between 1196 and 1783. Marble Arch is also in the same area, and beyond that ranges the shopping maelstrom of Oxford St.A soothing monument, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is a circular stream that cascades gently and reassembles in a pool at the bottom; paddling is encouraged.	5am-midnight	['5:00 - 24:00', '29:00 - 48:00', '53:00 - 72:00', '77:00 - 96:00', '101:00 - 120:00', '125:00 - 144:00', '149:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 0:00']		http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park	True	False	90		['Park']	['Gardens', 'Nature & Parks']	-0.165247739925	51.5087730148	6.5	4.5	['3806', '1648', '289', '64', '75']		Rangers Lodge, , London, W2 2UH	True	13		[]
Apsley House	england	london	activity	This stunning house, containing exhibits about the Duke of Wellington, victor of Waterloo against Napoleon Bonaparte, was once the first building to appear when entering London from the west and was therefore known as 'No 1 London'. Wellington memorabilia, including the duke's death mask, fills the basement gallery, while an astonishing collection of china and silver, and paintings by Velasquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Brueghel, Murillo and Goya awaits in the 1st-floor Waterloo Gallery.	The stairwell is dominated by Antonio Canova’s staggering 3.4m-high statue of a fig-leafed Napoleon with titanic shoulders, adjudged by the subject as ‘too athletic’.

Buckingham Palace	england	london	activity	Built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham, Buckingham Palace replaced St James's Palace as the monarch's official London residence in 1837. When she’s not delivering her trademark wave to far-flung parts of the Commonwealth, Queen Elizabeth II divides her time between here, Windsor and, in summer, Balmoral. If she’s at home, the yellow, red and blue standard is flying. Some 19 lavishly furnished State Rooms are open to visitors when HRH (Her Royal Highness) takes her holidays from late July to September.	Hung with artworks by the likes of Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Canaletto, Poussin and Vermeer, the State Rooms are open for two-hour tours that include the Throne Room, with his-and-hers pink chairs initialed 'ER' and 'P'. Access is by timed tickets with admission every 15 minutes (audio guide included).From 2016, admission included access to Fashioning a Reign: 90 Years of Style from The Queen's Wardrobe, an exhibition affording a glimpse at royal couture during the Queen's reign.Admission also includes access to part of the garden at Buckingham Palace as you exit, although you will have to join the three-hour State Rooms and Garden Highlights Tour (adult/child £27.50/16.40) to see the wisteria-clad Summer House and other famous features, and get an idea of the garden's full 16-hectare size.Your ticket to Buckingham Palace is good for a return trip if bought direct from the palace ticket office (ask to have it stamped). You can even make your ticket purchase a donation and gain free access for a whole year (ask at the ticket office).At 11.30am daily from April to July (on alternate days, weather permitting, for the rest of the year), the old guard (Foot Guards of the Household Regiment) comes off duty to be replaced by the new guard on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, an event known as the Changing of the Guard. Highly popular, the show lasts about 40 minutes (brace for crowds).Originally designed by John Nash as a conservatory, the Queen’s Gallery showcases some of the palace’s treasures on a rotating basis, through temporary exhibitions. Entrance to the gallery is through Buckingham Gate.Indulge your Cinderella fantasies while inspecting the exquisite state coaches in the Royal Mews, a working stable looking after the royals’ immaculately groomed horses and the opulent vehicles they use for getting from A to B.

Trafalgar Square	england	london	activity	In many ways Trafalgar Sq is is the centre of London, where rallies and marches take place, tens of thousands of revellers usher in the New Year and locals congregate for anything from communal open-air cinema and Christmas celebrations to various political protests. It is dominated by the 52m-high Nelson's Column and ringed by many splendid buildings, including the National Gallery and St Martin-in-the-Fields. The Nazis once planned to shift Nelson's Column to Berlin in the wake of a successful invasion.	The great square was neglected over many years, ringed with traffic and given over to flocks of feral pigeons fed by tourists and locals alike. In 2000, a scheme was launched to transform the square into the kind of space John Nash had intended it to be when he designed it in the early 19th century. Traffic was banished from the northern flank in front of the National Gallery, the pigeons were sent packing and a new pedestrian plaza built, making way for cohorts of living statues, gravity-defying Yodas and other street artistes.Note the much-overlooked, if not quite ignored brass plaques recording the precise length of imperial units – including the yard, the perch, pole, chain and link – set into the stonework and steps below the National Gallery and dating from the 19th century.

Wallace Collection	england	london	activity	Arguably London’s finest smaller gallery, the Wallace Collection is an enthralling glimpse into 18th-century aristocratic life. The sumptuously restored Italianate mansion houses a treasure-trove of 17th- and 18th-century paintings, porcelain, artefacts and furniture collected by generations of the same family and bequeathed to the nation by the widow of Sir Richard Wallace (1818–90) on the condition it remain displayed in the same fashion.	Among the many highlights here are paintings by Rembrandt, Hals, Delacroix, Titian, Rubens, Poussin, Van Dyck, Velàzquez, Reynolds and Gainsborough in the stunning Great Gallery; look out for the Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals. Beyond the stunning chandeliers and a sweeping staircase that is reckoned to be one of the best examples of French interior architecture in existence, there’s also an astonishing array of armour and weapons, both medieval and Renaisance European and Oriental. There are also temporary exhibitions (paid admission) and very popular themed events involving Marie Antoinette and other French aristocrats, costumes and ballroom dancing (check the website for what’s on when you’re here).Have lunch at the excellent glass-roofed restaurant Wallace, which occupies the central courtyard, and you’ll have spent one of the most outstanding days in London.	10am-5pm	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']		http://www.wallacecollection.org	True	False	90		['Museum']	['Historic Sites', 'Art Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	-0.152875	51.517122	6.5	4.5	['3049', '796', '106', '27', '7']	Hertford House, Manchester Sq	Hertford House Manchester Square, , London, W1U 3BN	True	15		[]
Tower Bridge	england	london	activity	London was a thriving port in 1894 when elegant Tower Bridge was built. Designed to be raised to allow ships to pass, electricity has now taken over from the original steam and hydraulic engines. A lift leads up from the northern tower to the Tower Bridge Exhibition, where the story of its building is recounted within the upper walkway. You then walk down to the fascinating Victorian Engine Rooms, which powered the bridge lifts.	A new 11m-long glass walkway also allows you to look down into the waters 42m below, and if you're lucky, to view the bridge being raised. The bridge is still lifted around 1000 times per year to allow large vessels to pass; consult the Tower Bridge Exhibition website for times to watch this in action.

Monument	england	london	activity	Sir Christopher Wren's 1677 column, known simply as the Monument, is a memorial to the Great Fire of London of 1666, whose impact on London’s history cannot be overstated. An immense Doric column made of Portland stone, the Monument is 4.5m wide and 60.6m tall – the exact distance it stands from the bakery in Pudding Lane where the fire is thought to have started.	The Monument is topped with a gilded bronze urn of flames that some think resembles a big gold pincushion. Although Lilliputian by today’s standards, the Monument would have been gigantic when built, towering over London. An earlier Wren design for the Monument had the column topped with a phoenix rising from the ashes, while another substituted that for a large statue of Charles II, before the current appearance was selected.Climbing up the column’s 311 spiral steps rewards you with some of the best 360-degree views over London (due to its central location as much as to its height). And after your descent, you’ll also be the proud owner of a certificate that commemorates your achievement. At the time of research, the memorial was closed for maintenance and repair, but should be open by the time you read this. Note that tickets can be purchased with cash only.	9.30am-6pm Apr-Sep, to 5.30pm Oct-Mar	['9:30 - 17:30', '33:30 - 41:30', '57:30 - 65:30', '81:30 - 89:30', '105:30 - 113:30', '129:30 - 137:30', '153:30 - 161:30']		http://www.themonument.info	True	False	30	adult/child £4/2, incl Tower Bridge Exhibition £10.50/4.70	['Tower']	['Historic Sites', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.085884	51.510145	6.0	4.0	['511', '485', '128', '11', '3']	Junction of Fish Street Hill & Monument St	Monument St., , London, EC3R 8AH	True	122	30	[]
Highgate Cemetery	england	london	activity	A Gothic wonderland of shrouded urns, obelisks, broken columns, sleeping angels, Egyptian-style tombs and overgrown graves, Highgate is a Victorian Valhalla spread over 20 wonderfully wild and atmospheric hectares. On the eastern side you can pay your respects to the graves of Karl Marx and Mary Ann Evans (better known as novelist George Eliot). The real highlight, however, is the overgrown West Cemetery, which can only be visited on a guided tour; bookings are essential for weekday tours.	Highgate remains a working cemetery – the most recent well-known internment was Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died under sinister circumstances in 2006, when the radioactive isotope Polonium 210 somehow made it into his tea in a Mayfair hotel. As his body was still so radioactive, the unfortunate Russian had to be buried in a special lead-lined coffin.Tours of the East Cemetery (adult/child £8/4) take place at 2pm some Saturdays (not every Saturday, check on the website).	10am-5pm Mon-Fri, 11am-5pm Sat & Sun	[]		http://www.highgatecemetery.org	True	False	150	East Cemetery adult/child £4/free	['Cemetery']	['Cemeteries', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.146492	51.566774	6.5	4.5	['432', '163', '28', '11', '7']	Swain's Lane	Swains Lane, , London, N6 6PJ	True	62	150	[]
Hampstead Heath	england	london	activity	Sprawling Hampstead Heath, with its rolling woodlands and meadows, feels a million miles away – despite being approximately four miles – from the City of London. Covering 320 hectares, most of it woods, hills and meadows, it's home to about 180 bird species, 23 species of butterflies, grass snakes, bats and a rich array of flora.	It's a wonderful place for a ramble, especially to the top of Parliament Hill, which offers expansive views across the city and is one of the most popular places in London to fly a kite. Alternatively head up the hill in North Wood or lose yourself in the West Heath.If walking is too pedestrian for you, another major attraction is the bathing ponds (separate beautiful ones for men and women and a slightly less pleasant mixed pond). Those of a more artistic bent should make a beeline for Kenwood.Once you've had your fill of fresh air and/or culture, do as Londoners do and head to one of the wonderful nearby pubs for a restorative pint.

British Library	england	london	activity	Consisting of low-slung red-brick terraces and fronted by a large plaza featuring an oversized statue of Sir Isaac Newton, Colin St John Wilson’s British Library building is a love-it-or-hate-it affair (Prince Charles likened it to a secret-police academy). Completed in 1997, it's home to some of the greatest treasures of the written word, including the Codex Sinaiticus (the first complete text of the New Testament), Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks and a copy of the Magna Carta (1215).	The most precious manuscripts are held in the Sir John Ritblat Gallery, including the stunningly illustrated Jain sacred texts, explorer Captain Scott's final diary, Shakespeare's First Folio (1623), Gutenberg's Bible of 1455, a copy of The Diamond Sutra in Chinese dating to 868 – the world's oldest (block-) printed book – as well as handwritten lyrics by the Beatles and Handel's Messiah.	galleries 9.30am-6pm Mon & Fri, 9.30am-5pm Sat, 9.30am-8pm Tue-Thu, 11am-5pm Sun	['11:00 - 17:00', '33:30 - 42:00', '57:30 - 68:00', '81:30 - 90:00', '105:30 - 114:00', '129:30 - 138:00', '153:30 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/b35a3f5076a12c9ed196565f4bb378a58c990ee7cd0d8ea395772cd5662f812d/cab65979dbd1cbbf8230f033b77375d084305d1f6c1137d668d81bbc3ccee462.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.bl.uk	True	False	90		['Library']	['Libraries', 'History Museums', 'Traveler Resources', 'Museums']	-0.127459	51.529385	6.5	4.5	['1344', '519', '94', '27', '12']	96 Euston Rd	96 Euston Road, , London, NW1 2DB	True	44	90	[]

More than a museum, it's an opportunity to meditate on the minutiae of everyday Georgian life through silent exploration.

Cutty Sark	england	london	activity	This Greenwich landmark, the last of the great clipper ships to sail between China and England in the 19th century, saw £25 million of extensive renovations largely precipitated by a disastrous fire in 2007. The exhibition in the ship's hold tells her story as a tea clipper at the end of the 19th century (and then wool and mixed cargo).	Launched in 1869 in Scotland, she made eight voyages to China in the 1870s, sailing out with a mixed cargo and coming back with a bounty of tea. As you make your way up, there are films, interactive maps and plenty of illustrations and props to get an idea of what life on board was like.

St John's Gate	england	london	activity	This remarkable Tudor gate dates to 1504. During the 12th century, the Knights Hospitaller (a Christian and military order with a focus on providing care to the sick) established a priory here. Inside is a small museum that covers the history of the order (including rare examples of the knights’ armour), as well as its 19th-century revival in Britain as the secular Order of St John and the foundation of St John Ambulance.	The gate was erected as a grand entrance to the priory and survived, although most of the buildings were destroyed when Henry VIII dissolved every monastery in the country between 1536 and 1540. It enjoyed a varied afterlife, not least as a Latin-speaking coffee house, which was run without much success by William Hogarth’s father during Queen Anne’s reign. Restored in the 19th century, it also housed the Old Jerusalem Tavern, where writers and artists, including Charles Dickens, met.Try to time your visit with one of the comprehensive 80-minute guided tours of the gate and the priory church. You’ll also be shown upstairs to the sumptuous 1902 chapter hall and council chamber, which are still used by the order to this day.	10am-5pm Mon-Sat year-round, 10am-5pm Sun July-Aug, tours 11am & 2.30pm Tue, Fri & Sat	[]		http://www.museumstjohn.org.uk	True	False	90	tour suggested donation £5	['Historic Building']	['Historic Sites', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.102578	51.521975	5.5	4.5	['8', '5', '0', '0', '0']	St John's Lane	St John_s Lane, , London, EC1M 4DA	False	723		[]
Imperial War Museum	england	london	activity	Fronted by a pair of intimidating 15in naval guns, this riveting museum is housed in what was the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, a psychiatric hospital also known as Bedlam. Although the museum’s focus is on military action involving British or Commonwealth troops largely during the 20th century, it rolls out the carpet to war in the wider sense. Highlights include the state-of-the-art First World War Galleries and Witnesses to War in the forecourt and atrium above.	Indeed, Witnesses to War is where you'll find everything from a Battle of Britain Spitfire and a towering German V-2 rocket to a Reuters Land Rover damaged by rocket attack in Gaza and a section of the World Trade Center in New York.On the 1st floor A Family in Wartime poignantly follows WWII through the experiences of the real-life Allpress family of Stockwell. In Secret War on the 2nd floor, there’s an intriguing rifle through the work of the Secret Operations Executive (SOE), such as rubber soles resembling feet worn underneath boots to leave ‘footprints’ on enemy beaches. One of the most challenging sections is the extensive and harrowing Holocaust Exhibition (not recommended for under 14s), the entrance of which is on the 4th floor. Curiosities of War is a jumble sale of fascinating items, such as a makeshift bar used by the Dam Busters crew in 1943, taken from the museum's collection. Other galleries and exhibition spaces are given over to temporary exhibitions (check the website for details).Augustus Pugin, famous Gothic Revival architect of the interior of the Houses of Parliament, was once a patient in the psychiatric wards of the former Bethlehem Royal Hospital. The hospital moved in 1930 and the building became home to the Imperial War Museum in 1936.	10am-6pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/8e5397ca5323a20496f63ce9612a8626-imperial-war-museum.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.iwm.org.uk	True	False	120		['Museum']	['History Museums', 'Military Museums', 'Museums']	-0.108523926	51.495645019	6.5	4.5	['3680', '1346', '433', '267', '175']	Lambeth Rd	Lambeth Road, , London, SE1 6HZ	True	41		[]
National Maritime Museum	england	london	activity	Narrating the long, briny and eventful history of seafaring Britain, this excellent museum's exhibits are arranged thematically, with highlights including Miss Britain III (the first boat to top 100mph on open water) from 1933, the 19m-long golden state barge built in 1732 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the huge ship's propeller and the colourful figureheads installed on the ground floor. Families will love these, as well as the ship simulator and the 'All Hands' children's gallery on the 2nd floor.	Under eights can get to grips with all things nautical in the 'Ahoy!' gallery, also on the ground floor. Adults are likely to prefer the fantastic (and slightly more serene) galleries. 'Voyagers: Britons and the Sea' on the ground floor is an introduction to the collection and showcases some of the museum's incredible archives. JMW Turner's largest work and controversial for its chronological inaccuracies, the huge 1824 oil painting The Battle of Trafalgar is hung in its namesake gallery on the ground floor.On the 1st floor, 'Traders: the East India Company and Asia' looks back on Britain's maritime trade with the East in the 19th century, while 'The Atlantic: Slavery, Trade, Empire' explores the triangular trade between Europe, Africa and America from the 1600s to the 1850s.On the 2nd floor, the award-winning 'Nelson, Navy, Nation 1688–1815' focuses on the history of the Royal Navy during the conflict-ridden 17th century. It provides an excellent look at the legendary national hero and, through documents and memorabilia, explains his achievements and dazzling celebrity. The coat in which Nelson was fatally wounded during the Battle of Trafalgar takes pride of place.	10am-5pm	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']		http://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum	True	False	150		['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.005515	51.480969	6.0	4.0	['451', '368', '133', '80', '34']	Romney Rd	Park Row, , London, SE10 9NF	True	160	150	[]
ArcelorMittal Orbit	england	london	activity	Love it or loathe it, Turner Prize–winner Anish Kapoor's 115m-high, twisted-steel sculpture towers strikingly over the southern end of Olympic Park. In essence it's an artwork, but at the 80m mark it also offers a stunning panorama from its mirrored viewing platform, which is accessed by a lift from the base of the sculpture (the tallest in the UK). A dramatic tunnel slide running down the tower is the world's highest and longest, coiling 178m down to ground level.	Descend 4m (via a caged external staircase) from the platform for more vistas, interpretative screens and an outside section. From here, you can opt to skip down 455 steps to the ground (accompanied by soundscapes of London) or hop back in the lift. Alternatively, weave your way down on the superb tunnel slide (worth the extra £3), which takes 40 seconds to get you back down.For a truly unique night out, attend an Orbit Late, when live music and DJs are hosted in the viewing platforms. For further thrills, take a free-fall abseil off the tower (£85, book ahead).The tower has had its share of critics, with the Daily Mail likening it to a collision between two cranes. London's loquacious former mayor Boris Johnson he famously described it as a giant hubble-bubble pipe (we think he means a shisha water pipe) and so the 'hubble-bubble tower' it is.	10am-6pm Apr-Sep, to 5pm Oct-Mar	['35:00 - 41:00', '59:00 - 65:00', '83:00 - 89:00', '107:00 - 113:00', '131:00 - 137:00', '10:00 - 18:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.arcelormittalorbit.com	True	False	90	adult/child £12/7, with slide adult/child £15/10	['Tower']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.01266	51.538328	5.5	4.5	['633', '357', '109', '32', '30']	Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park	3 Thornton Street, , London, E20 2AD	False	99	90	[]
Museum of London Docklands	england	london	activity	Housed in an 1802 warehouse, this educational museum combines artefacts and multimedia displays to chart the history of the city through its river and docks. The best strategy is to begin on the 3rd floor, where displays cover the Roman settlement of Londinium, and work your way down through the ages. Perhaps the most illuminating and certainly the most disturbing gallery is London, Sugar and Slavery, which examines the capital’s role in the transatlantic slave trade.	Highlights include a scale model of old London Bridge, back when it was lined with buildings, and Sailortown, a re-creation of the cobbled streets, bars and lodging houses of a mid-19th-century dockside community. It displays fascinating facts too, for example, when London Bridge was demolished in 1831, its wood and iron was recycled into knives and forks, while its successor was dismantled and shipped to Arizona in the United States and reassembled there in 1971. There are also fascinating displays on the docks during the two world wars and their controversial transformation into the Docklands during the 1980s.There’s a lot for kids, including the hands-on Mudlarks gallery, where children can explore the history of the Thames, tipping the clipper, trying on old-fashioned diving helmets and even constructing a simple model of Canary Wharf. The museum has special exhibitions every few months, for which there is usually a charge.	10am-6pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/docklands	True	False	150		['Museum']	['History Museums', 'Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.023829	51.50742	6.5	4.5	['374', '178', '40', '6', '1']	West India Quay	1 The Warehouse Hertsmere Road, , London, E14 4AL	True	79	150	[]

Inspired by Victorian-era cabinets of curiosities (wunderkabinnet), Wynd's wilfully eccentric collection includes stuffed birds, pickled genitals, two-headed lambs, shrunken heads, a key to the Garden of Eden, dodo bones, celebrity excrement, ancient Chinese dildos and toys from McDonald's Happy Meals. A self-confessed 'incoherent vision of the world displayed through wonder', make of it what you will. Or stop by for a cocktail (£8) at the tiny bar.	A subjective and thought-provoking collection, it's an admirable and frequently illuminating attempt to convey the wonder and horrors of the natural world.

The main focal point is the stadium, with a Games capacity of 80,000, scaled back to 54,000 seats for its new role as the home ground for West Ham United FC.

It houses the world's largest collection of decorative arts, from Asian ceramics to Middle Eastern rugs, Chinese paintings, Western furniture, fashion from all ages and modern-day domestic appliances. The temporary exhibitions are another highlight, covering anything from David Bowie retrospectives to designer Alexander McQueen, special materials and trends.	There are more than 100 galleries in the museum, so pick carefully or join a free one-hour guided tour; there are several a day (they meet close to the information desk in the main hall), on a variety of themes including introductory tours, Medieval and Renaissance tours and theatre and performance tours.	10am-5.45pm Sat-Thu, to 10pm Fri	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-133646334_large.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.vam.ac.uk	True	False			['Museum']	[]	-0.172194654	51.496773888			[]	Cromwell Rd		False			[]
Museum of London	england	london	activity	One of the capital’s best museums, this is a fascinating walk through the various incarnations of the city from Roman Londinium and Anglo-Saxon Ludenwic to 21st-century metropolis contained in two-dozen galleries. There are a lot of interactive displays with an emphasis on experience rather than learning.	The first gallery, London Before London, brings to life the ancient settlements that predated the capital and is followed by the Roman era, which is full of excellent displays, models and archaeological finds. The rest of the floor takes you through the Saxon, medieval (don't miss the 1348 Black Death video), Tudor and Stuart periods, culminating in the Great Fire of 1666.After a glimpse of the real Roman wall from the window, head down to the modern galleries where, in the first one, Expanding City, you’ll find exquisite fashion and jewellery, the graffitied walls of a prison cell (1750) and the Rhinebeck Panorama, an incredibly detailed watercolour of London in 1806–07. After a quick spin through the re-created Pleasure Gardens, you emerge onto a glorious re-creation of a Victorian street. Highlights of the galleries leading up to the present day include a 1908 taxi cab, a 1928 art-deco lift from Selfridges, an interactive water pump that makes clear the perils of the once-insanitary water system and costumes worn by East End Pearly Kings and Queens. The testimonies of ordinary people from WWII are particularly moving, and in the last City Gallery you’ll spot the impressive Lord Mayor’s coach dating from 1757. Free 40-minute highlight tours depart daily at 11am, noon, 3pm and 4pm.With visitor numbers recently doubling, the museum is slated to move from its current location (where it has been for 40 years) to nearby Smithfield Market, giving the new museum a fabulous Victorian setting, extra gallery space and a fantastic entrance. The new location will provide 27,000 sq metres of exhibition space instead of the current 17,000 sq metres, allowing many historic objects to be displayed for the first time and enhancing the visitor experience.	10am-6pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk	True	False	150		['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.096645	51.517569	6.5	4.5	['1863', '1027', '228', '63', '25']	150 London Wall	150 London Wall, , London, EC2Y 5HN	True	46	150	[]
Sir John Soane's Museum	england	london	activity	This little museum is one of the most atmospheric and fascinating in London.The building is the beautiful, bewitching home of architect Sir John Soane (1753–1837), which he left brimming with his vast architectural and archaeological collection, as well as intriguing personal effects and curiosities. The museum represents his exquisite and eccentric tastes, persuasions and proclivities.	A famous Regency architect and professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, Soane was a country bricklayer’s son, most famous for designing the Bank of England and the Dulwich Picture Gallery. In his work and life, he drew on classical ideas picked up while on an 18th-century grand tour of Italy. After his marriage with the wealthy Elizabeth Smith, known as Eliza Soane, the architect built his house-museum at No 13 Lincoln’s Inn Sq, and eventually bought the one next door at No 12, which now serves as an exhibition and education space.The heritage-listed house is largely as it was when Soane died and is itself a main part of the attraction. It has a canopy dome that brings light right down to the crypt, a colonnade filled with statuary and a picture gallery where paintings are stowed behind each other on folding wooden panes. This is where Soane’s choicest artwork is displayed, including paintings by Canaletto, architectural drawings by Christopher Wren and Robert Adam, and the original Rake’s Progress, William Hogarth’s set of satirical cartoons of late-8th-century London lowlife. Among Soane’s more unusual acquisitions are the sarcophagus of the Egyptian Pharo Seti I; a mock-up of a monk’s cell in the basement of the house, and his precious Model Room, located in his private apartments at the 2nd floor of the house, in which a large portion of his collection of original architectural models of classical buildings is on display.Mobile phones must be switched off and photography is not allowed. Tours (£10) depart at 11.30am Tuesday and Friday, at 3.30pm Wednesday and Thursday and at 11am Saturday. The evening of the first Tuesday of each month, when the house is lit by candles, is very popular and sees long queues.	10am-5pm Tue-Sat & 6-9pm 1st Tue of month	['58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/148277155_master.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.soane.org	True	False	120		['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-0.117545	51.516815	6.5	4.5	['691', '214', '49', '16', '9']	13 Lincoln's Inn Fields	13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, , London, WC2A 3BP	True	63		[]
Somerset House	england	london	activity	Designed by William Chambers in 1775 for royal societies, Somerset House now contains two fabulous galleries. Near the Strand entrance, the Courtauld Gallery displays a wealth of 14th- to 20th-century art, including masterpieces by Rubens, Botticelli, Cézanne, Degas, Renoir, Seurat, Manet, Monet, Leger and others. Downstairs, the Embankment Galleries are devoted to temporary (mostly photographic) exhibitions; prices and hours vary.	The first Somerset House was a palace built for the Duke of Somerset, brother of Jane Seymour, in 1551. For two centuries, it played host to royals (Elizabeth I once lived here), foreign diplomats, wild masked balls, peace treaties, the Parliamentary army (during the Civil War) and Oliver Cromwell's wake. Having fallen into disrepair, it was pulled down in 1775 and rebuilt in 1801 to designs by Chambers. Among other weighty organisations, it went on to house the Royal Academy of Arts, the Society of Antiquaries, the Navy Board and, that most popular of institutions, the Inland Revenue.The tax collectors are still here, but that doesn't dissuade Londoners from attending open-air events in the grand Safra Fountain Court, such as live performances and Film4 Summer Screen films in summer, and ice skating in winter. Children love cavorting through the fountains in the court on warm summer days. The riverside terrace is a popular spot for coffee with a view of the Thames.	galleries 10am-6pm, Safra Courtyard 7.30am-11pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.somersethouse.org.uk	True	False	90		['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.118024460873	51.5107238312	6.5	4.5	['292', '196', '45', '15', '8']	The Strand	The Strand, , London, London WC2R 1LA	True	128		[]
St Bartholomew-the-Great	england	london	activity	Dating to 1123 and adjoining one of London's oldest hospitals, St Bartholomew-the-Great is one of London's most ancient churches. The authentic Norman arches and profound sense of history lend this holy space an ancient calm, while approaching from nearby Smithfield Market through the restored 13th-century half-timbered archway is like walking back in time. The church was originally part of the monastery of Augustinian Canons, but became the parish church of Smithfield in 1539 when King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries.	William Hogarth was baptised here and the young American statesman Benjamin Franklin worked in the yard as an apprentice printer. The church has been used as a setting for many films and TV productions, including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Shakespeare in Love, Sherlock Holmes and a very funny mobile-phone advertisement satirising the royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Look out for the astonishing Damien Hirst gilded statue of St Bartholomew with his flayed skin, located in the south transept by the the steps to the south doors. The Cloister Cafe in the 15th-century cloister is great for a meal or snack and can be accessed without paying the entrance fee.	8.30am-5pm Mon-Fri, 10.30am-4pm Sat, 8.30am-8pm Sun	['32:30 - 41:00', '56:30 - 65:00', '80:30 - 89:00', '104:30 - 113:00', '128:30 - 137:00', '8:30 - 19:00', '152:30 - 163:00']		http://www.greatstbarts.com	True	False	30	adult/concession £5/4.50	['Church']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.099821	51.518671	6.5	4.5	['88', '23', '1', '2', '6']	West Smithfield	West Smithfield, , London, EC1A 9DS	True	288	30	[]
Science Museum	england	london	activity	With seven floors of interactive and educational exhibits, this scientifically spellbinding museum will mesmerise adults and children alike, covering everything from early technology to space travel. A perennial favourite is Exploring Space, a gallery featuring genuine rockets and satellites and a full-size replica of 'Eagle', the lander that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the Moon in 1969. The Making the Modern World Gallery next door is a visual feast of locomotives, planes, cars and other revolutionary inventions.	The fantastic Information Age Gallery on level 2 showcases how information and communication technologies – from the telegraph to smartphones – have transformed our lives since the 19th century. Standout displays include wireless sent by a sinking Titanic, the first BBC radio broadcast and a Soviet BESM 1965 super-computer. Also on level 2 is Media Space, a gallery dedicated to excellent photographic exhibitions from the National Photography Collection (adult/child £8/free).The 3rd-floor Flight Gallery (free tours 1pm most days) is a favourite place for children, with its gliders, hot-air balloons and aircraft, including the Gipsy Moth, which Amy Johnson flew to Australia in 1930. This floor also features a Red Arrows 3D flight simulation theatre (adult/children £6/5) and Fly 360-degree flight-simulator capsules (£12 per capsule). Launchpad, on the same floor, is stuffed with (free) hands-on gadgets exploring physic and the properties of liquids.Glimpses of Medical History on level 4 isn't as high-tech as the rest of the museum but is highly evocative with models and life-size reconstructions showing how medicine – from child birth to dentistry – was practised through the ages.If you’ve kids under the age of five, pop down to the basement and the Garden, where there’s a fun-filled play zone, including a water-play area, besieged by tots in orange waterproof smocks.	10am-6pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk	True	False	150		['Museum']	['Science Museums', 'Museums']	-0.174365	51.497416	6.0	4.0	['2182', '1344', '597', '183', '109']	Exhibition Rd	Exhibition Road, , London, SW7 2DD	True	75	150	[]

Kew Gardens	england	london	activity	In 1759 botanists began rummaging around the world for specimens to plant in the 3-hectare Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. They never stopped collecting, and the gardens, which have bloomed to 120 hectares, provide the most comprehensive botanical collection on earth (including the world's largest collection of orchids). A Unesco World Heritage Site, the gardens can easily devour a day's exploration; for those pressed for time, the Kew Explorer hop-on/hop-off road train takes in the main sights.	Don't worry if you don't know your golden slipper orchid from your fengoky or your quiver tree from your alang-alang; a visit to Kew is a journey of discovery for everyone. Highlights include the enormous early Victorian Palm House, a hothouse of metal and curved sheets of glass; the impressive Princess of Wales Conservatory; the red-brick, 1631 Kew Palace, formerly King George III's country retreat; the cele­brated Chinese Pagoda designed by William Chambers in 1762 (closed for restoration until 2018); the Temperate House, the world's largest ornamental glasshouse (closed for restoration until 2018); and the very enjoyable Rhizotron  Xstrata Treetop Walkway, where you can survey the tree canopy from 18m up in the air. A lattice fashioned from thousands of pieces of aluminium illuminated with hundreds of LED lights, the 17m-high Hive mimics activity within a real beehive (it's on show till late 2017). Check the website for a full list of activities at Kew from free one-hour walking tours (daily), photography walks, theatre performances, outside cinema as well as a host of seasonal events and things to do.Kew Gardens are easily reached by tube, but you might prefer to take a cruise on a riverboat from the Westminster Passenger Services Association, which runs several daily boats from April to October, departing from Westminster Pier.	10am-6.30pm Apr-Aug, closes earlier Sep-Mar	['9:30 - 18:00', '33:30 - 42:00', '57:30 - 66:00', '81:30 - 90:00', '105:30 - 114:00', '129:30 - 138:00', '153:30 - 162:00']		http://www.kew.org	True	False	90	adult/child £15/3.50	['Gardens']	['Gardens', 'National Parks', 'Nature & Parks']	-0.306181149213	51.472345049	6.5	4.5	['2120', '845', '232', '125', '140']	Kew Rd	Kew Green, , Kew, TW9 3AB	True	1		[]
Southwark Cathedral	england	london	activity	The earliest surviving parts of this relatively small cathedral are the retrochoir at the eastern end, which contains four chapels and was part of the 13th-century Priory of St Mary Overie, some ancient arcading by the southwest door and an arch that dates to the original Norman church.

Southbank Centre	england	london	activity	The flagship venue of the Southbank Centre, Europe's largest centre for performing and visual arts, is the Royal Festival Hall. Its gently curved facade of glass and Portland stone is more humane than its 1970s Brutalist neighbours. It is one of London's leading music venues and the epicentre of life on this part of the South Bank, hosting cafes, restaurants, shops and bars.	Just north, the austere Queen Elizabeth Hall is a Brutalist icon, the second-largest concert venue in the centre, hosting chamber orchestras, quartets, choirs, dance performances and sometimes opera. Underneath its elevated floor is a graffiti-decorated skateboarders’ hang-out, in recent years bravely fending off plans to convert the space for restaurants and shops that would have sent the skateboarders rolling. The plans were part of a new Festival Wing development that has been put on hold.The opinion-dividing 1968 Hayward Gallery, another Brutalist beauty, is a leading contemporary-art exhibition space.The QEH and Hayward Gallery are both closed till 2017 for 21st-century facelifts.

London Eye	england	london	activity	Standing 135m high in a fairly flat city, the London Eye affords views 25 miles in every direction, weather permitting. Interactive tablets provide great information (in six languages) about landmarks as they appear in the skyline. Each rotation – or 'flight' – takes a gracefully slow 30 minutes.

London Dungeon	england	london	activity	Older kids tend to love the London Dungeon, as the terrifying queues during school holidays and weekends test­ify. It's all spooky music, ghostly boat rides, macabre hangman's drop-rides, fake blood and actors dressed up as torturers and gory criminals (including Jack the Ripper and Sweeney Todd) with interactive scares galore.	The highlights are the vaudevillian delights of being sentenced by a mad, bewigged judge on trumped-up charges, the utterly disorienting Whitechapel Labyrinth, the Drop Dead Drop Ride (which has you 'plummeting' to your death by hanging from the gallows) and Escape the Great Fire of London, rounded off with a stop in the Tavern.It takes about 90 minutes to work your way through the gory dungeon.

Horniman Museum	england	london	activity	This museum is an extraordinary place, comprising the original collection of wealthy tea-merchant and pack-rat Frederick John Horniman. He had this art-nouveau building, with its clock tower and mosaics, specially designed to house his collection. Built in 1901, today it encompasses everything from a dusty stuffed walrus and voodoo altars from Haiti and Benin to a mock-up of a Fijian reef and a collection of concertinas. It’s wonderful.	On the ground and 1st floors is the Natural History Gallery, the core of the Horniman collection, with animal skeletons and pickled specimens. On the lower ground floor you’ll find the African Worlds Gallery, the first permanent gallery of African and Afro-Caribbean art and culture in the UK. The Music Gallery next door has instruments from 3500-year-old Egyptian clappers and early English keyboards, to Indonesian gamelan and Ghanaian drums, with touch screens so you can hear what they sound like and videos to see them being played in situ. The Centenary Gallery traces the history of the museum’s first 100 years. The aquarium (admission charge) in the basement is small but state of the art. The cafe, with seating in the stunning conservatory, is a delight, as are the surrounding 6.5 hectares of hillside and landscaped gardens with views of far-flung central London. On a warm summer's day, they are beautiful.To get here from Forest Hill station, turn left out of the station onto the South Circular and head straight up north along London Rd.

There are photo ops with your dream celebrity (Daniel Craig, Miley Cyrus, Audrey Hepburn, the Beckhams), the Bollywood gathering (studs Hrithik Roshan and Salman Khan) and the Royal Appointment (the Queen, Harry, William and Kate).	If you’re into politics, get up close and personal with Barack Obama or Vladimir Putin, while Luke Skywalker and Han Solo enthusiasts can turn to the Star Wars experience which features a host of its key heroes and villains in iconic settings. Even two of the UK's leading vloggers are cast in wax for their adoring fans.The whole place is pretty commercial, with shops and spending opportunities in every room. But the Spirit of London taxi ride through the city's history is great, educational fun, while the Chamber of Horrors is as scary as ever.The museum has a long and interesting history since the French artist and model-maker Marie Tussaud (1761–1850) started making death masks of people guillotined during the French Revolution. She came to London in 1803 and exhibited around 30 wax models in nearby Baker St, providing visitors with their only glimpse of the famous and infamous before photography was widespread.	8.30am-6pm Mon-Thu, 9am-6pm Fri-Sun	['33:30 - 41:30', '57:30 - 65:30', '81:30 - 89:30', '105:30 - 113:30', '129:30 - 137:30', '9:00 - 18:00', '153:00 - 162:00']		http://www.madame-tussauds.com/london	True	False	210	adult/child £35/29.50	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.155053	51.522696	6.0	4.0	['4046', '3822', '2345', '941', '781']	Marylebone Rd	Marylebone Road, , London, NW1 5LR	True	83	210	[]
Tate Britain	england	london	activity	Splendidly reopened a few years back with a stunning new art-deco-inspired staircase and a rehung collection, the older and more venerable of the two Tate siblings celebrates paintings from 1500 to the present, with works from Blake, Hogarth, Gainsborough, Barbara Hepworth, Whistler, Constable and Turner, as well as vibrant modern and contemporary pieces from Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and Henry Moore. Join a free 45-minute thematic tour (daily at 11am) and 15-minute Art in Focus talks (1.15pm Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday).	The stars of the show at Tate Britain are, undoubtedly, the light infused visions of JMW Turner in the Clore Gallery. After he died in 1851, his estate was settled by a decree declaring that whatever had been found in his studio – 300 oil paintings and about 30,000 sketches and drawings – would be bequeathed to the nation. The collection at the Tate Britain constitutes a grand and sweeping display of his work, including classics such as The Scarlet Sunset and Norham Castle, Sunrise.There are also seminal works from Constable, Gainsborough and Reynolds, as well as the pre-Rahaelites, including William Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience, John William Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott, Ophelia by John Everett Millais and Edward Burne-Jones's The Golden Stairs. Look out also for Francis Bacon's Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. Tate Britain hosts the prestigious and often controversial Turner Prize for Contemporary Art from October to early December every year.The Tate Britain also has a program of ticketed exhibitions which changes every few months; consult the website for details of the latest exhibition.The ticket office closes at 5.15pm.	10am-6pm, to 10pm 1st Fri of month	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.tate.org.uk	True	False	90		['Gallery']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-0.127243656207	51.4908344972	6.5	4.5	['943', '460', '110', '36', '9']	Millbank	Millbank, , London, SW1P 4RG	True	52	90	[]
Camden Market	england	london	activity	Although – or perhaps because – it stopped being cutting-edge several thousand cheap leather jackets ago, Camden Market gets a whopping 10 million visitors each year and is one of London's most popular attractions. What started out as a collection of attractive craft stalls by Camden Lock on the Regent's Canal now extends most of the way from Camden Town tube station to Chalk Farm tube station.	There are four main market areas – Buck Street Market, Lock Market, Canal Market and Stables Market – although they seem to blend together with the crowds snaking along and the 'normal' shops lining the streets. You'll find a bit of everything: clothes (of variable quality) in profusion, bags, jewellery, arts and crafts, candles, incense and myriad decorative titbits.There are dozens of food stalls at the Lock Market and the Stables Market. Virtually every type of cuisine is offered, from French to Argentinian, Japanese and Caribbean. Quality varies, but is generally pretty good and affordable. You can eat at the big communal tables or by the canal.	10am-6pm	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '154:00 - 162:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/0f9fe9bff9036a683b426dbab7cd14bb-camden-market.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.camdenmarket.com	True	False	210		['Market']	['Flea & Street Markets', 'Shopping']	-0.146706	51.541571	6.5	4.5	['4407', '2241', '703', '187', '103']	Camden High St	Camden Lock Place, , London, NW1 8AF	True	24	210	[]
Royal Observatory	england	london	activity	Rising south of Queen's House, idyllic Greenwich Park climbs up the hill, affording stunning views of London from the Royal Observatory, which Charles II had built in 1675 to help solve the riddle of longitude. To the north is lovely Flamsteed House and the Meridian Courtyard, where you can stand with your feet straddling the western and eastern hemispheres; admission is by ticket. The southern half contains the highly informative and free Weller Astronomy Galleries and the Peter Harrison Planetarium.	In 1884 Greenwich was designated as the prime meridian of the world, and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) became the universal measurement of standard time.	10am-5pm Sep-Jun, to 6pm Jul-Aug	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']		http://www.rmg.co.uk	True	False	90	adult/child £9.50/5, with Cutty Sark £18.50/8.50	['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	-0.001899	51.477808	6.0	4.0	['655', '568', '225', '84', '26']	Greenwich Park, Blackheath Ave	Romney Road, , London, SE10 9NF	True	137		[]
Kensington Palace	england	london	activity	Built in 1605, the palace became the favourite royal residence under William and Mary of Orange in 1689, and remained so until George III became king and relocated to Buckingham Palace. Today, it is still a royal residence, with the likes of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (Prince William and his wife Catherine) and Prince Harry living there. A large part of the palace is open to the public, however, including the King's and Queen's State Apartments.	The King's State Apartments are the most lavish, starting with the Grand Staircase, a dizzying feast of trompe l'oeil. The beautiful Cupola Room, once the venue of choice for music and dance, is arranged with gilded statues and a gorgeous painted ceiling. The Drawing Room is beyond, where the king and courtiers would entertain themselves with cards.Visitors can also access Victoria's apartments where Queen Victoria (1819–1901) was born and lived until she became Queen. An informative narrative about her life is told through a few personal effects, extracts from her journals and plenty of visual props.A long-running exhibition about royal dress, Fashion Rules, is also on show, with dresses from Queen Elizabeth in the 1950s, her sister Princess Margaret in the 1960s and 1970s and Diana, Princess of Wales, in the 1980s.Don't overlook the splendid gardens, including the charming sunken garden and the 'cradle walk' arbour that surrounds it.

Natural History Museum	england	london	activity	This colossal and magnificent-looking building is infused with the irrepressible Victorian spirit of collecting, cataloguing and interpreting the natural world. The Dinosaurs Gallery (Blue Zone) is a must for children, who gawp at the animatronic T-Rex, fossils and excellent displays. Adults for their part will love the intriguing Treasures exhibition in the Cadogan Gallery (Green Zone), which houses a host of unrelated objects each telling its own unique story, from a chunk of moon rock to a dodo skeleton.	Also in the Green Zone, the Mineral Gallery is a breathtaking display of architectural perspective leading to the Vault, where you'll find the Aurora Collection of almost 300 coloured diamonds. In the Orange Zone, the vast Darwin Centre focuses on taxonomy, showcasing 28 million insects and six million plants in a giant cocoon; glass windows allow you to watch scientists at work.At the centre of the museum is Hintze Hall, which resembles a cathedral nave – quite fitting for a time when the natural sciences were challenging the biblical tenets of Christian orthodoxy. The hall is dominated by the over-arching cast of a Diplodocus skeleton (nicknamed Dippy), which is due to be replaced by the real skeleton of a diving blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), hung from the ceiling, in 2017. The hall will be shut for the first half of 2017 to accommodate the changes, but the other galleries will remain open.A slice of English countryside in SW7, the beautiful Wildlife Garden next to the West Lawn encompasses a range of British lowland habitats, including a meadow with farm gates and a bee tree where a colony of honey bees fills the air.In 2018, the eastern grounds are also due to be redesigned to feature a geological and palaeontological walk, with a bronze sculpture of Dippy as well as ferns and cycads.The entire museum and its gardens cover a huge 5.7 hectares and contains 80 million specimens from across the natural world. More than five million visitors come each year, so queues can sometimes get long, especially during the school holidays.	10am-5.50pm	['10:00 - 17:50', '34:00 - 41:50', '58:00 - 65:50', '82:00 - 89:50', '106:00 - 113:50', '130:00 - 137:50', '154:00 - 161:50']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-157673427_medium.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.nhm.ac.uk	True	True	210		['Museum']	['History Museums', 'Natural History Museums', 'Museums']	-0.176286	51.495886	6.5	4.5	['8552', '3163', '1081', '288', '110']	Cromwell Rd	Cromwell Road, , London, SW7 5BD	False	10	210	[]
Westminster Abbey	england	london	activity	A splendid mixture of architectural styles, Westminster Abbey is considered the finest example of Early English Gothic (1190–1300). It's not merely a beautiful place of worship – the Abbey also serves up the country's history cold on slabs of stone. For centuries the country's greatest have been interred here, including 17 monarchs from Henry III (died 1272) to George II (1760). Never a cathedral (the seat of a bishop), Westminster Abbey is what is called a 'royal peculiar', administered by the Crown.	Every monarch since William the Conqueror has been crowned here, with the exception of a couple of unlucky Eds who were either murdered (Edward V) or abdicated (Edward VIII) before the magic moment.At the heart of the Abbey is the beautifully tiled sanctuary (or sacrarium), a stage for coronations, royal weddings and funerals. George Gilbert Scott designed the ornate high altar in 1873. In front of the altar is the Cosmati marble pavement dating to 1268. It has intricate designs of small pieces of marble inlaid into plain marble, which predicts the end of the world in AD 19,693! At the entrance to the lovely Chapel of St John the Baptist is a sublime alabaster Virgin and Child bathed in candle light.The most sacred spot in the Abbey, the shrine of St Edward the Confessor, lies behind the high altar; access is generally restricted to protect the 13th-century flooring. St Edward was the founder of the Abbey and the original building was consecrated a few weeks before his death. His tomb was slightly altered after the original was destroyed during the Reformation but still contains Edward’s remains – the only complete saint's body in Britain. Ninety-minute verger-led tours of the Abbey include a visit to the shrine.The Quire, a sublime structure of gold, blue and red Victorian Gothic by Edward Blore, dates back to the mid-19th century. It sits where the original choir for the monks' worship would have been but bears no resemblance to the original. Nowadays, the Quire is still used for singing, but its regular occupants are the Westminster Choir – 22 boys and 12 ‘lay vicars’ (men) who sing the daily services.The original church was built in the 11th century by King (later Saint) Edward the Confessor, who is buried in the chapel behind the main altar. Henry III began work on the new building in 1245 but didn't complete it; the Gothic nave was finished under Richard II in 1388. Henry VII's magnificent Perpendicular Gothic-style Lady Chapel was consecrated in 1519 after 16 years of construction. The vestibule of the Lady Chapel is the usual place for the rather ordinary-looking Coronation Chair, upon which every monarch since the early 14th century has been crowned (apart from joint-monarch Mary II, who had her own chair fashioned for her coronation, which is now in the Westminster Abbey Museum).Apart from the royal graves, keep an eye out for the many famous commoners interred here, especially in Poets' Corner, where you'll find the resting places of Chaucer, Dickens, Hardy, Tennyson, Dr Johnson and Kipling, as well as memorials to the other greats (Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Brontë etc). Nearby you'll find the graves of Handel and Sir Isaac Newton.The octagonal Chapter House dates from the 1250s and was where the monks would meet for daily prayer before Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries some three centuries later. To the right of the entrance to Chapter House is what is claimed to be the oldest door in Britain – it’s been there for 950 years. Used as a treasury and 'Royal Wardrobe', the crypt-like Pyx Chamber dates from about 1070. Next door in the vaulted undercroft, the museum exhibits the death masks of generations of royalty, wax effigies representing Charles II and William III (who is on a stool to make him as tall as his wife, Mary II), armour and stained glass. Highlights are the graffiti-inscribed Mary Chair (used for the coronation of Mary II) and the Westminster Retable, England's oldest altarpiece, from the 13th century.Parts of the Abbey complex are free to visitors. This includes the Cloister and the 900-year-old College Garden. Adjacent to the abbey is St Margaret's Church, the House of Commons' place of worship since 1614, where windows commemorate churchgoers Caxton and Milton, and Sir Walter Raleigh is buried by the altar.In the works are the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries, a new museum and gallery space located in the medieval triforium, and due to open in 2018.	9.30am-4.30pm Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri, to 7pm Wed, to 2.30pm Sat	['33:30 - 39:30', '57:30 - 63:30', '81:30 - 90:00', '105:30 - 111:30', '129:30 - 135:30', '153:30 - 159:30']		http://www.westminster-abbey.org	True	True	90	adult/child £20/9, verger tours £5, cloister & gardens free	['Church']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.12750259	51.499213048	6.5	4.5	['5779', '1759', '402', '124', '82']	20 Dean's Yard	Broad Sanctuary, , London, SW1P 3PA	False	16	90	[]
Houses of Parliament	england	london	activity	A visit here is a journey to the heart of UK democracy. Officially called the Palace of Westminster, the Houses of Parliament's oldest part is 11th-century Westminster Hall, one of only a few sections that survived a catastrophic fire in 1834. Its roof, added between 1394–1401, is the earliest-known example of a hammerbeam roof. The rest is mostly a neo-Gothic confection built by Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin (1840–58).The palace's most famous feature is its clock tower, Elizabeth Tower, aka Big Ben.	Ben is actually the 13.5-ton bell, named after Benjamin Hall, who was Commissioner of Works when the tower was completed in 1858.At the business end, parliament is split into two houses. The green-hued House of Commons is the lower house, where the 650 elected Members of Parliament sit. Traditionally the home of hereditary blue bloods, the scarlet-decorated House of Lords, with 763 members, now has peers appointed through various means. Both houses debate and vote on legislation, which is then presented to the Queen for her Royal Assent (in practice, this is a formality; the last time Royal Assent was denied was in 1708). At the annual State Opening of Parliament, which takes place in May, the Queen takes her throne in the House of Lords, having arrived in the gold-trimmed Irish State Coach from Buckingham Palace (her crown travels alone in Queen Alexandra's State Coach). It's well worth lining the route for a gawk at the crown jewels sparkling in the sun.On Saturdays year-round and on most weekdays during parliamentary recesses including Easter, summer and Christmas, visitors can join a 90-minute guided tour of both chambers, Westminster Hall and other historic buildings conducted by qualified Blue Badge Tourist Guides in seven languages. Afternoon tea in the Terrace Pavilion overlooking the River Thames is a popular add-on to the tours. Tour schedules change with every recess and are occasionally subject to variation or cancellation due to the State Opening of Parliament and other parliamentary business, so check ahead and book. UK residents can approach their MPs to arrange a free tour and to climb the Elizabeth Tower.The public entrance to the Houses of Parliament is St Stephen's Entrance, housed within St Stephen's Tower.

British Museum	england	london	activity	The country's largest museum and one of the oldest and finest in the world, this famous museum boasts vast Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, European and Middle Eastern galleries, among others. It is frequently London’s most-visited attraction, drawing over six million visitors annually.Don't miss the Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering Egyptian hiero­glyphics, discovered in 1799; the controversial Parthenon Sculptures, taken from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin (the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire); and the large collection of Egyptian mummies.	Other must-sees include the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo burial relics and the Winged Bulls from Khorsabad.Begun in 1753 with a 'cabinet of curiosities' sold to the nation by royal physician Sir Hans Sloane, the collection mushroomed over the ensuing years partly through acquisitions, bequests and plundering the empire. The grand Enlightenment Gallery was the first section of the redesigned museum to be built in the 1820s.The Great Court, restored and augmented by Norman Foster in 2000, has a spectacular glass-and-steel roof, making it one of the most impressive architectural spaces in the capital. In the centre is the Reading Room, with its stunning blue-and-gold domed ceiling made of papier mâché, where Karl Marx researched and wrote Das Kapital.The British Museum's new extension, the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre in its northwestern corner, opened in 2014, in the same year as the new Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery which hosts high-profile exhibitions.The museum is huge, so make a few focused visits if you have time, and consider taking one of the free tours. There are 15 free 30- to 40-minute eye-opener tours of individual galleries per day. The museum also has free daily gallery talks, a highlights tour (adult/chilld £12/free, 11.30am and 2pm Friday, Saturday and Sunday), free 45-minute lunchtime gallery talks (1.15pm Tuesday to Friday) and free 20-minute spotlight tours on Friday evenings.

Tate Modern	england	london	activity	One of London's most amazing attractions, this outstanding modern- and contemporary-art gallery is housed in the creatively revamped Bankside Power Station south of the Millennium Bridge. A spellbinding synthesis of modern art and capacious industrial brick design, Tate Modern has been extraordinarily successful in bringing challenging work to the masses, both through its free permanent collection and fee-paying, big-name temporary exhibitions. A stunning new extension opened in 2016, increasing the available exhibition space by 60%.	The 4.2 million bricks of the 200m-long Tate Modern is an imposing sight, designed by Swiss architects Herzog and de Meuron, who scooped the prestigious Pritzker Prize for their transformation of the empty power station. Leaving the building's central 99m-high chimney, adding a two-storey glass box onto the roof and employing the cavernous Turbine Hall as a dramatic entrance space were three huge achievements. Herzog and de Meuron also designed the new 11-storey Tate extension.As a supreme collection of modern art, the contents of the museum are, however, the main draw. At their disposal, the curators have paintings by Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Andy Warhol, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock as well as pieces by Joseph Beuys, Damien Hirst, Claes Oldenburg and Auguste Rodin.Tate Modern's permanent collection is arranged by both theme and chronology on levels 2, 3 and 4. More than 60,000 works are on constant rotation, so if there's a particular work you would like to see, check the website to see if (and where) it's hanging.The location is also supreme, as the ever-popular balconies on level 3 with their magnificent views of St Paul's will attest. The Millennium Bridge elegantly conveys views direct from the Tate Modern to St Paul's Cathedral in the City on the far bank of the river.Free guided highlights tours depart at 11am, noon, 2pm and 3pm daily. Audio guides (in five languages) are available for £4 – they contain information about 50 artworks across the gallery and offer suggested tours for adults or children. Note the late-night opening hours on Friday and Saturday.To visit the sister-museum Tate Britain, hop on the Tate Boat from Bankside Pier.	10am-6pm Sun-Thu, to 10pm Fri & Sat	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '130:00 - 142:00', '154:00 - 166:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/40062e1086a9347efa50de2c1e98b5ac-tate-modern.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.tate.org.uk	True	False	90		['Museum']	['Art Museums', 'Museums']	-0.099413	51.507641	6.0	4.0	['1783', '1229', '679', '326', '195']	Queen's Walk	53 Bankside, , London, SE1 9TG	True	93	90	[]
Tower of London	england	london	activity	The unmissable Tower of London (actually a castle of 22 towers) offers a window into a gruesome and compelling history. This was where two kings and three queens met their death and countless others were imprisoned. Come here to see the colourful Yeoman Warders (or Beefeaters), the spectacular Crown Jewels, the soothsaying ravens and armour fit for a very large king.	In the 1070s, William the Conqueror started work on the White Tower to replace the castle he'd previously had built here. By 1285, two walls with towers and a moat were built around it and the defences have barely been altered since. A former royal residence, treasury, mint and armoury, it became most famous as a prison when Henry VIII moved to Whitehall Palace in 1529 and started meting out his preferred brand of punishment.The most striking building is the central White Tower, with its solid Norman architecture and four turrets. Today, on the entrance floor it houses a collection from the Royal Armouries, including Henry VIII's commodious suit of armour. On the 1st floor is St John's Chapel, dating from 1080 and therefore the oldest church in London. To the north stands Waterloo Barracks, which now contains the spectacular Crown Jewels, including the platinum crown of the late Queen Mother, set with the 106-carat Koh-i-Noor (Mountain of Light) diamond and the Imperial State Crown, worn by the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament. Slow-moving travelators shunt wide-eyed visitors past the collection. On the far side of the White Tower is the Bloody Tower, where the 12-year-old Edward V and his little brother Richard were held 'for their own safety' and later murdered, perhaps by their uncle, the future Richard III.

Royal Academy of Arts	england	london	activity	 Britain’s oldest society devoted to fine arts was founded in 1768, moving to Burlington House exactly a century later. The collection contains drawings, paintings, architectural designs, photographs and sculptures by past and present Academicians such as Joshua Reynolds, John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, JMW Turner, David Hockney and Norman Foster. 	 Highlights are displayed in the John Madejski Fine Rooms on the 1st floor, which are accessible by free guided tours. Displays change regularly.The rooms themselves are a treat; it was in the Reynolds Room on the 1st floor for instance that Charles Darwin first presented his groundbreaking ideas on evolutionary biology to the Linnean Society.The famous Summer Exhibition, which has showcased contemporary art for sale by unknown as well as established artists for nearly 250 years, is the Academy’s biggest annual event.Burlington House’s courtyard features a stone-paved piazza with choreographed lights and fountains arranged to display the astrological star chart of Joshua Reynolds, the RA first president, on the day he was born. His statue stands in the centre. The courtyard is also the venue for temporarily installed statues and outdoor works by contemporary artists.The academy has grown its exhibition space by expanding magnificently into 6 Burlington Gardens and is undergoing an ambitious redevelopment through to 2018.	10am-6pm Sat-Thu, to 10pm Fri	['130:00 - 142:00', '10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 42:00', '58:00 - 66:00', '82:00 - 90:00', '106:00 - 114:00', '154:00 - 162:00']		http://www.royalacademy.org.uk	True	False	90	adult/child £10/6, prices vary for exhibitions	['Gallery']	['Educational sites', 'Art Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	-0.139078	51.508435	6.5	4.5	['716', '333', '110', '45', '33']	Burlington House, Piccadilly	Burlington House Piccadilly, , London, W1J 0BD	True	87		[]
Wellcome Collection	england	london	activity	Focusing on the interface of art, science and medicine, this clever and resourceful museum is fascinating. There are interactive displays where you can scan your face and watch it stretched into the statistical average, wacky modern sculptures inspired by various medical conditions, and downright creepy things, such as an actual cross section of a body and enlargements of parasites (fleas, body lice, scabies) at terrifying proportions.	Beyond the permanent galleries, there are absorbing temporary exhibitions too and a fantastic Reading Room which doubles as a gallery and events space, while the cafe and a restaurant provide food and drink.	10am-6pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, to 10pm Thu	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-157901765_master.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.wellcomecollection.org	True	False	150		['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.133939	51.526027	6.5	4.5	['326', '170', '39', '6', '6']	183 Euston Rd	183 Euston Road, , London, NW1 2BE	True	92	150	[]
Kenwood	england	london	activity	This magnificent neoclassical mansion stands at the northern end of Hampstead Heath in a glorious sweep of landscaped gardens leading down to a picturesque lake. The 17th-century house was substantially remodelled in the 1760s and rescued from developers by Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, who donated it and the wonderful collection of art it contains to the nation in 1927. Among its treasures are paintings by such greats as Rembrandt (one of his many self-portraits), Constable, Gainsborough and Vermeer.	The Iveagh Bequest, as it is known, is one of the finest small collections in Britain. Head up the great stairs for the Suffolk Collection, consisting of Jacobean portraits by William Larkin and a set of royal Stuart portraits.Junior aristocrats will enjoy the Orangery, where there's a collection of toys and a large doll's house.In spring the gardens erupt in a blaze of rhododendrons and camellias. It's also worth seeking out the sculptures by Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth on the lawn.

Geffrye Museum	england	london	activity	If you like nosing around other people's homes, you'll love this museum, entirely devoted to middle-class domestic interiors. Built in 1714 as a home for poor pensioners, these beautiful ivy-clad brick almshouses have been converted into a series of living rooms, dating from 1630 to the present day. The rear garden is also organised by era, mirroring the museum’s exploration of domesticity through the centuries. There's also a very impressive walled herb garden, featuring 170 different plants.	An extension completed in 1998 contains several 20th-century rooms (a flat from the 1930s, a 1960s lounge room and an all-too-familiar 1990s loft-style apartment) as well as a gallery for temporary exhibits, a shop and a cafe.One of the original almshouses has been completely restored and furnished to show the living conditions of the original pensioners in the 18th and 19th centuries. It’s the absolute attention to detail that impresses, right down to the vintage newspaper left open on the breakfast table. The setting is so fragile, however, that tours (adult/child £4/free) are only held a few times a month and places are limited; check the website for up-to-date schedules.

Borough Market	england	london	activity	Located here in some form or another since the 13th century (and possibly since 1014), ‘London’s Larder’ has enjoyed an astonishing renaissance in the past 15 years. Always overflowing with food lovers, inveterate gastronomes, wide-eyed visitors and Londoners in search of inspiration for their dinner party, this fantastic market has become firmly established as a sight in its own right. The market specialises in high-end fresh products; there are also plenty of takeaway stalls and an unreasonable number of cake stalls!	Many of the lunch stalls cluster in Green Market (the area closest to Southwark Cathedral). If you'd rather eat indoors, there are some fantastic cafes and restaurants too – try Monmouth Coffee or Arabica Bar  Kitchen.The market simply heaves on Saturdays so get here early for the best pickings or enjoy the craze at lunchtime: if you'd like some elbow space to enjoy your takeaway, head to Southwark Cathedral gardens or walk five minutes in either direction along the Thames for river views.Note that although the full market runs from Wednesday to Saturday, some traders and takeaway stalls do open Mondays and Tuesdays.	10am-5pm Wed & Thu, 10am-6pm Fri, 8am-5pm Sat	['34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 138:00', '152:00 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/assets/image/ccb9a4c38789a53cb6de6d18daa8f76a3c24610371ed99c0ca44937585f7df73/28ef67b4edc96a9cefc99e5de21e00101e9ac63a306c193efc7f8e4e56958704.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk	True	False			['Market']	['Flea & Street Markets', 'Shopping']	-0.089972	51.505043	6.5	4.5	['3825', '1398', '180', '25', '19']	8 Southwark St	8 Southwark Street, , London, SE1 1TL	True	17		[]
Hampton Court Palace	england	london	activity	Built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1514 but coaxed from him by Henry VIII just before Wolsey (as chancellor) fell from favour, Hampton Court Palace is England's largest and grandest Tudor structure. It was already one of Europe's most sophisticated palaces when, in the 17th century, Christopher Wren designed an extension. The result is a beautiful blend of Tudor and 'restrained baroque' architecture. You could easily spend a day exploring the palace and its 24 hectares of riverside gardens, including a 300-year-old maze.	Take a themed tour led by costumed historians or, if you're in a rush, visit the highlights: Henry VIII's State Apartments, including the Great Hall with its spectacular hammer-beamed roof; the Tudor Kitchens, staffed by 'servants'; the Wolsey Closet; the Chapel Royal; William III's  Mary II's Apartments, the King's Staircase and the Chocolate Kitchens; Mantegna's The Triumphs of Caesar; the restored and recently opened Cumberland Art Gallery off Clock Court; and the magnificent gardens, including the Kitchen Garden – and don't miss getting lost in the maze. The Magic Garden is a new interactive garden attraction for children and families. Also keep an eye out for the Real Tennis Court, dating from the 1620s. Do not overlook exploring the palace's magnificent riverside Gardens; on a sunny day it reveals London at its very finest and most beautiful. Check the schedule for spectacular shows and events, including Tudor jousting, falconry displays, ghost hunts (for children), garden adventures, family trails and more. In summer, fun 15- to 20-minute shire-horse-drawn charabanc tours (adult/child £6/3) depart from the East Front Garden between 11am and 5pm.Ask one of the red-tunic-garbed warders for anecdotes and information. The excellent audio tours can be picked up just off Base Court and then dropped off in the bin as you exit the palace to the gardens.Hampton Court is 13 miles southwest of central London and is easily reached by train from Waterloo.

In just a few hours, the palace was reduced to a smoking ruin, its goldfish, which swam in the ornamental ponds, ‘missing – believed boiled’, according to the Times.

Benjamin Franklin House	england	london	activity	 This modest house southeast of Trafalgar Sq is where American statesman Benjamin Franklin lived from 1757 to 1775 as he tried to broker peace with Britain and (unsuccessfully) avert war. Visits are by guided tour only, which depart at noon, 1pm, 2pm, 3.15pm and 4.15pm Wednesday to Sunday (architectural tours on Monday only).	Because the house is effectively empty – there are only a  few items associated with Franklin on display – the tour is conducted by a costumed guide playing Polly Stevenson, daughter of Franklin's landlord Margaret. Billed as 'museum as theatre' it's all a bit plodding and overly dramatic though the introductory film is quite instructive. About the most interesting things in the house are the human bones discovered during conservation work in 1998, now on display in the basement.

Central Criminal Court (Old Bailey)	england	london	activity	Taking in a trial in what's nicknamed the Old Bailey leaves watching a TV courtroom drama for dust. Even if you end up sitting in on a fairly run-of-the-mill trial, simply being in the court where such people as the Kray brothers and Oscar Wilde (in an earlier building on this site) once appeared is memorable.	The daily register of cases is outside, to the right of the main doorway on Old Bailey St; the public-gallery entrance is via Warwick Ct a few steps to the south. Choose from among 18 courts, of which the oldest – courts one to four – usually have the most interesting cases. As cameras, video equipment, mobile phones, large bags and food and drink are all forbidden inside, and there are no cloakrooms or lockers, it’s important not to take these with you. If you’re interested in a high-profile trial, get here early.The Central Criminal Court gets its nickname from the street on which it stands: baillie was Norman French for ‘enclosed courtyard’. The current building opened in 1907 on the combined site of a previous court and Newgate Prison. Intriguingly the figure of justice holding a sword and scales in her hands above the building’s copper dome is not blindfolded (against undue influence, as is traditionally the case).	9.45am-1pm & 2-4pm Mon-Fri	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-515030593_full.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk	False	False	90		['Historic Building']	['Government Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.101902	51.515359	4.5	4.5	['46', '19', '8', '3', '2']	cnr Newgate & Old Bailey Sts	Old Bailey, , London, EC4M 7EH	False	386		[]
Eltham Palace	england	london	activity	Rayon heir Stephen Courtauld (of Courtauld Gallery fame) and his wife Virginia (Ginie) built an art deco mansion next to a 15th-century medieval hall between 1933 and 1937. From the impressive entrance hall with its dome, African black-bean-panelled walls and huge circular carpet with geometric shapes, to the black-marble dining room with silver-foil ceiling and heavy black doors decorated with lacquered animal figures, it appears the couple had taste as well as money.	A £1.7-million refurbishment has opened up areas previously closed to the public. These include the decorated map room off Ginie's boudoir, where the couple plotted their extensive travels, and the basement, converted to a deluxe air-raid shelter during the Blitz. The couple also, rather fashionably for the times, had a pet lemur – the heated cage, complete with tropical murals and a bamboo ladder leading to the ground floor for the spoiled (and vicious) ‘Mah-jongg’ is also on view.A royal palace was built on this site in 1305 and was, for a time, the boyhood home of Henry VIII, before the Tudors decamped to Greenwich. Little of that palace remains, apart from the restored Great Medieval Hall incorporated into the mansion. Its hammer-beam roof is generally rated the third best in the country, behind those at Westminster Hall and Hampton Court Palace. The eight hectares of gardens include a rockery and moat with working bridge.Visitors view the mansion's 20 rooms on a self-paced tour with an entertaining handheld multimedia guide. 20 rooms audioguide Eltham Palace is equidistant – about a 20-minute walk – from Eltham and Mottingham stations (trains from London Bridge).	10am-5pm Sun-Wed Apr-Sep, to 4pm Oct, to 4pm Sun Nov-Mar	[]		http://www.english-heritage.org.uk	False	False	150	adult/child £13/7.80	['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Castles', 'Sights & Landmarks']	0.0483441352844	51.447160347	5.5	4.5	['364', '163', '31', '10', '6']	Court Yard, Eltham	Eltham Palace Court Yard, , London, SE9 5QE	True	70	150	[]
Queen's Chapel	england	london	activity	This small chapel is where contemporary royals such as Princess Diana and the Queen Mother have lain in their coffins in the run-up to their funerals. The church was originally built by Inigo Jones in the Palladian style for the French wife of Charles I  and was the the first post-Reformation Roman Catholic church erected in England.	 The simple interior, illuminated by light streaming through the large windows above the altar,  has exquisite 17th-century fittings.

St Martin-in-the-Fields	england	london	activity	The ‘royal parish church’ is a delightful fusion of classical and baroque styles. It was completed by James Gibbs in 1726 and serves as a model for many churches in New England. The church is well known for its excellent classical music concerts, many by candlelight, and its links to the Chinese community (services in English, Mandarin and Cantonese).  It usually closes for one hours at 1pm.	 The wonderful Cafe in the Crypt hosts jazz evenings at 8pm on Wednesday, there's brass rubbing in the shop for kids and you can visit the church with an audioguide (£3.50). Refurbishment excavations in the last decade unearthed a 1.5-tonne limestone Roman sarcophagus in the churchyard; the yard also holds the graves of 18th-century artists Joshua Reynolds and William Hogarth.	8.30am-6pm Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri, 8.30am-5pm Wed, 9.30am-6pm Sat, 3.30-5pm Sun	['11:00 - 18:00', '32:00 - 44:00', '56:00 - 68:00', '80:00 - 94:30', '104:00 - 117:00', '128:00 - 141:00', '152:00 - 165:00']		http://www.stmartin-in-the-fields.org	False	False	90		['Church']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Concerts & Shows']	-0.126652114	51.508766136	5.5	4.5	['387', '206', '28', '5', '8']	Trafalgar Sq		True	31	90	[]

Hunterian Museum	england	london	activity	The collection of anatomical specimens of pioneering surgeon John Hunter (1728–93) inspired this fascinating, slightly morbid, yet little-known museum. Among the more bizarre items on display are the skeleton of a 2.3m Irish giant named Charles Byrne, half of mathematician Charles Babbage’s brain (the other part is in the Science Museum) and, incongruously, Winston Churchill’s dentures.	The atmosphere is less gory than it once was but remains transfixing, with an impressive array of internal organs in a state of atrophy and disease, and explanations on trepanation and other medical curiosities. There's the bloated skull of a 25-year old victim of hydrocephalus and the model of a Chinese patient with a parasitic twin (1820). The art gallery contains Hunter's own paintings of 'exotics': Qing dynasty Chinese with queues (a plait worn at the back) and the original Siamese twins, Chang and Eng, with, well, each other. Upstairs there’s a display on surgery techniques, which will impress and repel in equal measure. The museum was bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1941, putting paid to two thirds of its collection. There’s a free curator-led guided tour at 1pm on Wednesday.

St Clement Danes	england	london	activity	Christopher Wren designed the original church here in 1682, but only the walls and a steeple added by James Gibbs in 1719 survived WWII bombing, after which the church was rebuilt as a memorial to Allied airmen. An 'island church'  named after the Danes who colonized Aldwych in the 9th century, St Clement Danes today is the chapel of the Royal Air Force (RAF), and there are some 800 slate badges of different squadrons set into the pavement of the nave. 	 The statue in front of the church quietly and contentiously commemorates the RAF’s Sir Arthur ‘Bomber’ Harris, who led the bombing raids that obliterated Dresden and killed up to 25,000 civilians during WWII. Should you pass the church at 9am, noon or 3pm, you may hear the bells chiming a distantly familiar tune. It's the 18th-century English nursery rhyme that incorporates the names of London churches starting: ‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clements’, with the soothing final lines: ‘Here comes a chopper to chop off your head/Chop, chop, chop, chop, the last man’s dead!’.	9am-4pm	[]		http://www.raf.mod.uk/stclementdanes	False	False	90		['Church']	['Sacred & Religious Sites', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.113766554	51.513073963	5.5	4.5	['37', '20', '3', '0', '0']	The Strand	Strand, , London, WC2R 1DH	True	357		[]

The ground floor is served up in an Orientalist style, its exquisite Arab Hall added in 1879 and densely covered with blue and green tiles from Rhodes, Cairo, Damascus, and Iznik in Turkey. 	A fountain tinkles away in the centre beneath the golden dome; even the wooden latticework of the windows and gallery was brought from Damascus.

Syon House	england	london	activity	Once a medieval abbey named after Mt Zion, Syon House was dissolved on the orders of Henry VIII and rebuilt into a residence. The house from where Lady Jane Grey ascended the throne for her nine-day  reign in 1553 was remodelled in the neoclassical style by Robert Adam  in the 18th century and has plenty of Adam furniture and oak panelling.  	The interior was designed on gender-specific lines, with pastel pinks  and purples for the ladies’ gallery, and mock Roman sculptures for the  men’s dining room. Just across the Thames from Kew Gardens, the estate’s 16-hectare gardens, with a lake and the  Great Conservatory (1820), were landscaped by Capability Brown. Syon  Park is filled with attractions for children, including an adventure  playground, aquatic park and trout fishery.

Golden Hinde	england	london	activity	Stepping aboard this replica of Sir Francis Drake’s famous Tudor ship will inspire genuine admiration for the admiral and his rather short (average height: 1.6m) crew, which counted between 40 and 60. It was in a tiny five-deck galleon just like this that Drake and his crew circumnavigated the globe from 1577 to 1580. Visitors can explore the ship by themselves or join a guided tour led by a costumed actor – children love these.	As well as guided tours, Golden Hinde runs a number of events designed for children where they can go on a treasure hunt, fire the cannons, raise the anchor, take part in games and listen to riveting stories.

Chiswick House	england	london	activity	Designed by the third Earl of Burlington (1694–1753) – fired up with passion for all things Roman after his grand tour of Italy – this stunner of a neo-Palladian pavillion with an octagonal dome and colonnaded portico is a delight. The almost overpoweringly grand interior includes the coffered dome of the Upper Tribunal – left ungilded, the walls below are decorated with eight enormous paintings.	Admire the stunningly painted ceiling (by William Kent) of the Blue Velvet Room and look out for carvings of the pagan vegetative deity, the Green Man, in the marble fireplaces of the Green Velvet Room.Lord Burlington also planned the house’s original gardens, now Chiswick Park, surrounding the house, but they have been much altered since his time. Children will love them – look out for the stone sphinxes near the Cedar of Lebanon trees (another sphinx made of lead can be found in the Lower Tribuna). Home to a splendid 19th century conservatory and a gateway designed by Inigo Jones, Chiswick House also has an excellent cafe.The house is about a mile southwest of the Turnham Green tube station and 750m northeast of Chiswick train station.	gardens 7am-dusk, house 10am-6pm Sun-Wed Apr-Sep, to 5pm Oct	[]		http://www.chgt.org.uk	False	False	90	adult/child £6.10/3.70, gardens free	['Historic Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.258434392189	51.4840422075	5.5	4.5	['88', '70', '19', '3', '4']	Burlington Lane, Chiswick Park	Chiswick House Chiswick House Grounds Burlington Lane, , London, W4 2RP	True	262		[]
Ham House	england	london	activity	Known as ‘Hampton Court in miniature’, much haunted Ham House was built in 1610 and became home to the first Earl of Dysart, unluckily employed as ‘whipping boy’ to Charles I.

Look out for ceiling paintings by Antonio Verrio, a miniature of Elizabeth I by Nicholas Hilliard and works by Constable and Reynolds. The grounds slope down to the Thames and lovely 17th-century formal gardens await exploration.	The garden ticket also allows you access to the below stairs rooms.

The low ceiling of the narrow staircase is a head-bumping reminder that the Sergeant Painter to the King  was under five foot tall at full stretch. The house was bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1940, but the artist's mulberry tree survived and still flourishes in the garden (which would be a quiet retreat were it not for the roaring dual carriageway beyond the wall), accompanied by daffodils in spring.

The Georgian interior contains some astonishing flourishes, including the hand-painted Chinese wallpaper in the dining parlour and some delectable furniture. Entrance is only possible on one of the guided tours but you are free to visit the park.	The poet Alexander Pope had a hand in designing the park, which stretches leisurely down to the Thames. To get there from St Margaret’s station, turn right along St Margaret’s Rd, then take the right fork along Crown Rd and turn left along Richmond Rd.

St Giles Church	england	london	activity	Built in what used to be countryside between the City of London and Westminster, St Giles-in-the-Fields isn’t much to look at but its history is a chronicle of London’s most miserable inhabitants. The current structure (1733) is the third to stand on the site of an original chapel built in the 12th century to serve as a hospital for lepers.	Until 1547, when the hospital closed, prisoners on their way to be executed at Tyburn stopped at the church gate and sipped a large cup of soporific ale – their last refreshment – from St Giles’s Bowl. From 1650, the prisoners were buried in the church grounds. It was also within the boundaries of St Giles that the Great Plague of 1665 took hold. In Victorian times, it was London’s worst slum, often mentioned in Dickens' novels. Today the drug users who hang out around the area make it feel like things haven’t changed much.An interesting relic in the church (north side) is the plain white pulpit that was used for 40 years by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism.	9am-4pm Mon-Fri	[]			False	False			['Church']	[]	-0.128338	51.515279			[]	60 St Giles High St		False			[]

The windmill, which ceased operating in 1864, contains a museum with working models on the history of windmills and milling. The adjacent Windmill Tearooms can supply tea, caffeine and sustenance.

Guildhall Galleries & Roman Amphitheatre	england	london	activity	The Guildhall Art Gallery provides a fascinating look at the politics of the Square Mile over the past few centuries, with a great collection of paintings of London in the 18th and 19th centuries, while the new City of London Heritage Gallery displays documents from the archives. Below the gallery is London's Roman Amphitheatre dating back to the early 2nd century AD.	Among the art gallery's works by (among others) Thomas Lawrence, George Frederick Watts and Lawrence Alma-Tadema is The Defeat of the Floating Batteries (1791) by the the American artist John Singleton Copley, which depicts the British victory at Gibraltar in 1782. This huge oil painting was removed to safety just a month before the gallery was hit by a German bomb in 1941 – it spent 50 years rolled up before a spectacular restoration in 1999.Sharing the same space, the heritage gallery displays such documents as a 1967 charter from William the Conqueror and a 1297 copy of the Magna Carta.The archaeological remains of the long-sought Roman amphitheatre (or coliseum) were only discovered in 1988 when work finally began on a new gallery after the original’s destruction in the Blitz. While only a few remnants of the stone walls lining the eastern entrance still stand, they’re imaginatively fleshed out with a black-and-fluorescent-green trompe l'oeil of the missing seating, and computer-meshed outlines of spectators and gladiators. Markings on the square outside the Guildhall indicate the original extent and scale of the amphitheatre, which could seat up to 6000 spectators.	10am-5pm Mon-Sat, noon-4pm Sun	[]		http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/guildhallgalleries	False	False	120		['Gallery']	['Art Galleries', 'Shopping', 'Museums']	-0.09158161295	51.5156838807	5.5	4.5	['122', '70', '13', '1', '0']	Guildhall Yard	Guildhall Yard, , London, EC2P 2EJ	True	152		[]

In the nave, note the pulpit taken from a Wren church on Cannon St that was destroyed in WWII and, by the south door, a Saxon archway and a beautiful 17th-century font cover decorated by the master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. The church has two strong American connections: William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania, was baptised here in 1644 and schooled in what is now the Parish Room; and John Quincy Adams, sixth president of the USA, was married here in 1797.

The first part of the church's name refers to a 3rd-centurty Christian martyr executed on a sizzling gridiron (see a copy of same atop the church spire). The second part tells us that this was once part of the Jewish quarter – the centre being Old Jewry, the street to the southeast.

St Bride's, Fleet Street	england	london	activity	Printing presses fell silent on Fleet St in the 1980s, but St Bride's, designed by Christopher Wren in 1672 and his tallest (and most expensive) church after St Paul's Cathedral, is still referred to as the 'journalists' church'. There's a moving chapel in the north aisle honouring journalists who've died or been injured in the course of their work.	The spire, added in 1703, is said to have inspired the design of the tiered wedding cake. The church was hit by bombs in December 1940, and the interior layout is wood-panelled, modern and not particularly attractive.In the 11th-century crypt, however, there’s a well-presented history of the church, its surrounding areas and the printing industry – don't miss the Roman pavement from the 2nd century AD.

Her story is told through memorabilia and documents – don't miss her (now stuffed) pet owl Athena and the lantern she carried while visiting the wards at night. Most illuminating are her letters and, highlight of the collection, a recording of her voice made in 1890, by which time she'd become one of the world’s first modern celebrities.	Nightingale led a team of nurses to Turkey in 1854 during the Crimean War, when more soldiers were dying in the hospital than on the battlefield, and vastly improved their care. Back in London, she set up a training school for nurses at St Thomas’s Hospital (where the museum is located) in 1859.The collection is divided into several key sections: her childhood and early life as a nurse; her work in the district of Scutari (now Üsküdar) of Istanbul; and her work at St Thomas's Hospital upon her return.

Red House	england	london	activity	From the outside, Red House is reminiscent of a gingerbread house wrought in stone. It was built in 1859 by Victorian designer William Morris – of Morris wallpaper fame. The nine rooms open to the public, including two bedrooms only recently accessible after being shut up for more than a century, bear all the elements of the Arts and Crafts Movement to which Morris adhered – Gothic art here, some religious symbolism there, an art nouveau–like sunburst over there.	Furniture by Morris and the house’s designer, Philip Webb, are on display, as are stained glass, paintings and murals (some only recently revealed under the wallpaper) by Edward Burne-Jones. The one-time kitchen has been converted into a lovely cafe. Entry before 1.30pm is by guided tour only.The surrounding gardens were designed by Morris ‘to clothe’ the house.

Charterhouse	england	london	activity	From a monastery, to a Tudor mansion, to the charitable foundation that's operated here since 1611, Charterhouse has played a discreet but important part in London's story. The history-steeped buildings can only be visited on fascinating 1½-hour guided tours (book online), or by attending the morning or evening services in the chapel. Tours commence at the 14th-century gatehouse on Charterhouse Sq and explore the complex's many grand halls, courts and gardens.	Charterhouse was founded in 1371 as a Carthusian monastery (the name derives from Chartreuse in France, where the order is based). The strictest of all Catholic monastic orders, the monks live mainly in isolation in their cells and take vows of silence, broken only for three hours on Sundays.In 1537 the monastery was dissolved and the property transferred to King Henry VIII. The prior and 15 of the monks were executed – some were hung, drawn and quartered at Tyburn (near Marble Arch) and the rest sent to Newgate Gaol, where they were chained upright and died of starvation. They were the first of England's Catholic martyrs of the Reformation and three of them were subsequently canonised.The king sold the property in 1545 to Sir Edward North, who converted it into his London mansion, knocking down the original church and much of the cloister in the process. In 1611 it was purchased by Thomas Sutton, known at the time as the ‘richest commoner in England’. In his will, Sutton directed that it should become a school for boys and an almshouse for ‘destitute gentlemen’. Around 40 pensioners (known as ‘brothers’) still live here today and one of their number leads the tours. Charterhouse School moved to Surrey in 1872 and is still going strong.Famous people associated with Charterhouse include Elizabeth I and James I, both of whom came here prior to their coronations. William Makepeace Thackeray (writer), John Wesley (the founder of the Methodist church) and Robert Baden-Powell (the founder of the scouts) all attended the school, while Purcell and Handel have played the chapel organ.	tours 2.15pm Tue-Thu & every 2nd Sat	[]		http://www.thecharterhouse.org	False	False		tours £10	['Historic Building']	['Gift & Specialty Shops', 'Shopping']	-0.099875	51.520921	6.0	5.0	['33', '8', '0', '0', '0']	Charterhouse Sq	The Charterhouse Charterhouse Square, , London, EC1M 6AN	True	76		[]

St John's Priory Church	england	london	activity	Clerkenwell has plenty of secrets and two of them are hidden in plain sight on St John's Sq: one of London's oldest churches and one of its prettiest little gardens. This whole area was originally part of the medieval St John's Priory and is now associated with the revived Order of St John. The walled garden, planted with medicinal herbs and flowers, was built as a memorial to St John's workers who died during the world wars.	If the somewhat boxy street-level church doesn't seem like it ever belonged to a medieval priory, that's because it didn't. The real treasure lies beneath, where the nave of the original church has been preserved as a darkened crypt. Built in the 1380s in the Norman Romanesque style, it's one of the oldest buildings in London. Inside there's a sturdy alabaster effigy of a Castilian knight (1575) and a battered monument portraying the last prior, Sir William Weston, as a decaying body in a shroud (a memento mori designed to remind viewers of their own mortality).The nave once abutted a large circular chancel that was demolished following the dissolution of the priory. Outside, the outline of the original church has been traced onto the square.	11am-4pm Mon-Sat	[]		http://www.museumstjohn.org.uk	False	False	90		['Church']	['Historic Sites', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.103222	51.522923	4.5	4.5	['8', '5', '0', '0', '0']	St John’s Sq	St John_s Lane, , London, EC1M 4DA	False	723		[]

Marx Memorial Library	england	london	activity	Built in 1738 to house a Welsh charity school, this unassuming building is an interesting reminder of Clerkenwell's radical history. In 1902 and 1903, during his European exile, Lenin edited 17 editions of the Russian-language Bolshevik newspaper Iskra (Spark) from here. Then in 1933, 50 years after the death of Karl Marx and around the time of the Nazi book burnings, it was decided that the building would be converted into a library to honour the founder of communism.	Copies of Iskra have been preserved in the library, along with other socialist literature, Spanish Civil War banners and relics from various industrial disputes. Tours visit the room where Lenin worked and the building's 15th-century cellar.If you think it's odd that Clerkenwell should have a memorial to Marx, you might be surprised to learn that from 1942 to 1951 a bust of Lenin stood in Holford Sq in neighbouring Finsbury, gazing towards his former residence.

Highlights include the Linenfold Parlour, where the Tudor oak panelling on the walls has been carved to resemble draped cloth; the panelled Great Chamber; the Victorian study; and the Georgian parlour.	Abandoned and taken over by squatters in the 1980s, Sutton House could have been lost to history. Enter the National Trust, which has set about conserving and preserving it.	noon-5pm Wed-Sun, daily Aug, closed Jan	['106:30 - 113:00', '130:30 - 137:00', '24:00 - 41:00', '168:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 17:00']		http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house	False	False	90	adult/child £3.50/1	['Historic Building']	['Historic Sites', 'History Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Museums']	-0.05049	51.548537	4.5	4.5	['25', '17', '8', '1', '0']	2-4 Homerton High St	Sutton House 2-4 Homerton High Street, , London, E9 6JQ	False	463		[]

Dalston Eastern Curve Gardens	england	london	activity	This garden is typical of the kind of grassroots regeneration happening around Dalston: a project led by the community, for the community, and a roaring success. There's a simple cafe and regular workshops and events, from gardening sessions to acoustic music. It’s a nice place to rest your legs, or to meet friendly locals.	The site used to be a derelict railway line and old sleepers have been used to make a boardwalk and raised beds for the veggie patch. Sadly, a question mark hangs over the garden's future as there are plans to redevelop the neighbouring shopping centre.	11am-7pm Sun-Thu, to 11pm Fri & Sat	[]		http://www.dalstongarden.org	False	False	90		['Gardens']	['Gardens', 'Nature & Parks']	-0.074168	51.546282	4.5	4.5	['6', '4', '1', '0', '0']	13 Dalston Lane	13 Dalston Lane, , London, E8 3DF	False	656		[]
Ragged School Museum	england	london	activity	Both adults and children are inevitably charmed by this combination of mock Victorian schoolroom (with hard wooden benches and desks, slates, chalk, inkwells and abacuses), re-created East End kitchen and social history museum. The school closed in 1908, but you can experience what it would have been like during its Sunday openings, when you can take part in a lesson. As a pupil you'll be taught reading, writing and ‘rithmetic by a strict school ma’am in full Victorian regalia.	The museum celebrates the legacy of Dr Thomas Barnardo, who founded this school for destitute East End children in the 1870s. ‘Ragged’ refers to the pupils’ usually torn, dirty and dishevelled clothes.

Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park	england	london	activity	Opened in 1841 this 13-hectare cemetery was the last of the ‘Magnificent Seven’: suburban cemeteries (including Highgate and Abney Park) created by an act of Parliament in response to London’s rapid population growth. Some 270,000 souls were laid to rest here until the cemetery was closed for burials in 1966 and turned into a park and local nature reserve in 2001.

Arsenal Emirates Stadium	england	london	activity	When Arsenal's new stadium opened in 2006, fans claimed it would never be the same again. It's true that the 64,000-seat stadium lacks some of the bonhomie of the old Highbury ground, but it's still a sell-out at every game. Match tickets are tricky to come by, even if you have a first-born to sacrifice, so if you're a fan, consider taking a stadium tour instead.	Self-guided audio tours (available in nine languages) are very entertaining, or you could shell out for a guided tour with a former Arsenal player. Both take you everywhere, from the back entrance used by the players to the entertainment suites where corporate bigwigs watch the game. You'll get to walk to the pitch through 'the tunnel', sit on the team's pitch-side benches and even check out the changing rooms (complete with a spa and physio suite on Arsenal's side).Tours also include entry to a museum that focuses on the history of the club and its fans, and is therefore likely to only interest the most ardent Arsenal supporters. Visits finish in the stadium's enormous shop where Arsenal merchandise of every guise is available.	10am-6pm Mon-Sat, to 4pm Sun	[]		http://www.arsenal.com/tours	False	False	90	self-guided tour adult/child £20/10, guided tour £40	['Stadium']	['Arenas & Stadiums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.109413	51.554101	5.5	4.5	['550', '183', '32', '17', '16']	Hornsey Rd	Hornsey Rd, , London, N7 7AJ	True	55		[]
St Pancras Station & Hotel	england	london	activity	Looking at the jaw-dropping Gothic splendour of St Pancras, it's hard to believe that the 1873 Midland Grand Hotel languished empty for years and even faced demolition in the 1960s. Now home to a five-star hotel, 67 luxury apartments and the Eurostar terminal, the entire complex has been returned to its former glory. Tours take you on a fascinating journey through the building's history, from its inception as the southern terminus for the Midlands Railway line.	Designed by George Gilbert Scott (who also built the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park), the Midland Grand Hotel was the most luxurious hotel in London when it first opened. All of the materials (including the stone, iron and 60 million red bricks) were brought down from the Midlands as a showcase for the kind of products the railway link could provide. The whole thing cost an astounding £438,000 – somewhere between £500 and £600 million in today's money.You can get an idea of the original over-the-top decor in the Gilbert Scott Bar, which was originally the hotel's reception. The neighbouring dining room (now a fine-dining restaurant run by acclaimed chef Marcus Wareing) showcases the more restrained style of a 1901 refurbishment. The building was incredibly modern for its time, with England's first hydraulic lift, London's first revolving door and a thick layer of concrete between the floors to act as a firebreak. Ironically, this contributed to its undoing, as it made it extremely difficult to adapt the rooms to new trends such as private bathrooms.The hotel closed in 1935 and was used for railway offices and finally abandoned in 1988. It was only when plans to use St Pancras as the Eurostar terminal came up in the 1990s that local authorities decided to renovate the building and open a hotel. The Eurostar first arrived at St Pancras International in 2007 and St Pancras Renaissance London Hotel opened its doors in 2011.Tours take you up the glorious grand staircase (the real star of the Spice Girls' Wannabe video) and along the exquisitely decorated corridors into one of the 37 remaining original Victorian rooms. They then head into the station proper, where sky-blue iron girders arc over what was, at the time, the largest unsupported space ever built. A modern addition to the concourse is Meeting Place, a giant statue of two lovers embracing by sculptor Paul Day – be sure to examine the wonderful railway-themed frieze winding around its base. Also worth a look is the the fabulously ornate Booking Office Bar  Restaurant, housed in the station's original ticket office.	tours 10.30am, noon, 2pm & 3.30pm Sat & Sun	[]			False	False		tour per person £20	['Historic Building']	[]	-0.125452	51.529832			[]	Euston Rd		False			[]
Keats House	england	london	activity	This elegant Regency house was home to the golden boy of the Romantic poets from 1818 to 1820. The house is sparsely furnished but does a good job of conveying what daily life would have been like in Keats’ day.	Never short of generous mates, Keats was persuaded to take refuge in this house by Charles Armitage Brown, and it was here that he met his fiancée Fanny Brawne, literally the girl next door. He wrote his most celebrated poem, 'Ode to a Nightingale', while sitting under a long-gone plum tree in the garden in 1819. 	1-5pm Tue-Sun Mar-Oct, Fri-Sun Nov-Feb	[]		http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/keats	False	False	90	adult/child £5.50/free	['Historic Building']	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.168035	51.555702	5.5	4.5	['32', '25', '6', '1', '0']	10 Keats Grove	10 Keats Grove, , London, NW3 2RR	True	373	90	[]
No 2 Willow Road	england	london	activity	Fans of modern architecture will want to swing past this property, the central house in a block of three designed by the ‘structural rationalist’ Ernö Goldfinger in 1939. Many people think it looks uncannily like the sort of mundane 1950s architecture you see everywhere. It may do now, but 2 Willow Rd was a forerunner in this style.	The interior has cleverly designed storage space, amazing light (rooms that couldn’t have a side window have a skylight) and a collection of artworks by Henry Moore, Max Ernst and Bridget Riley.

Abney Park Cemetery	england	london	activity	This enchanting place was bought and developed by a private firm in 1840 as a burial ground and arboretum catering for central London’s overflow. It was a dissenters (ie non–Church of England) cemetery and many of the most influential Presbyterians, Quakers and Baptists are buried here, including the Salvation Army founder, William Booth. The derelict chapel at its centre could be right out of a horror film, and the atmosphere of the whole place is nothing short of magical.	After being neglected for several decades, during which time it turned into a delightfully overgrown ruin and developed a reputation as a gay cruising ground, it's care was taken over by a charitable trust in 1991. It's now a managed wilderness, providing an important urban habitat for birds, butterflies and bugs – if you're very lucky you might spot tawny owls or sparrowhawks.The trust, based in the wonderful Egyptian-style entrance on Stoke Newington High St, hosts events in the cemetery and offers free guided tours (donations welcome) at 2pm on the first Sunday of the month.

William Morris Gallery	england	london	activity	Fans of Victoriana and the Arts and Crafts Movement should make time for this sensational little gallery. The beautiful Georgian mansion, located in Walthamstow in northeast London, was the family home of William Morris (1834–96), founder of interior-design company Morris  Co, famous far and wide for its patterned wallpaper. The gallery gives pride of place to his wide-ranging artistic endeavours, with a workshop explaining his production processes and an evocative re-creation of his shop.	The museum also covers Morris' activism and writing (for which he was more famous than his designs in his lifetime), providing a fully rounded portrait of the man. He was appalled by the consequences of industrialisation – on manufacturing processes, quality, people's living conditions and the environment – and he became a socialist in the 1880s, campaigning tirelessly against capitalism.The gallery's shop sells beautiful, Morris-inspired design objects and the Tea Room in the glasshouse is the perfect place for a break or a light lunch. Children will love the interactive displays, as well as the play area in the lovely park at the back.To get here from the tube station, turn right and then first left into Hoe St. Continue on this road for 600m and then turn left into Gaywood Rd.

Brunel Museum	england	london	activity	This small museum celebrates the world's first underwater tunnel, built here in 1843. The tunnel was the brainchild of engineer Marc Isambard Brunel (father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, another famous structural engineer), who had thought of a tunnel as an alternative to a bridge to allay congestion on the Thames. The museum has fascinating exhibits retracing the project's (mis)fortunes and the pioneering technology used to dig the tunnel.	Works started in 1825 and the tunnel, initially designed for pedestrians (it is now used by trains), opened to great fanfare in 1843. Guided tours (adult/child £10/free) that include access to the tunnel shaft, the former Grand Entrance, meet at Bermondsey tube station Mondays at 11am, Tuesdays at 4.30pm and Sundays at 10.45am.	10am-5pm	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']		http://www.brunel-museum.org.uk	False	False	150	adult/child £3/free	['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.053258	51.501016	3.5	3.5	['29', '50', '28', '13', '8']	Railway Ave	Brunel Engine House Railway Avenue, , London, SE16 4LF	False	456	150	[]
Handel & Hendrix in London	england	london	activity	George Frederick Handel lived in this 18th-century Mayfair building for 36 years until his death in 1759. This is where he composed some of his finest works, including Water Music, Messiah, Zadok the Priest and Fireworks Music. Following extensive restorations, the house looks as it would have when the great German-born composer was in residence. Enter from Lancashire Court (current work underway on the house aims to restore the entrance to that on Brook St).  	Early editions of Handel’s operas and oratorios, portraits of musicians and singers who worked with Handel, and musical instruments are on the 1st floor; musicians regularly come to practise so you may be treated to a free concert. On the 2nd floor there are more exhibits and quite a good film with music. The staff attending the rooms are all Handel enthusiasts and wonderfully knowledgeable. Children are admitted free on Saturdays and Sundays. Ticketed events at the house include plays, concerts and recitals.    The house at No 23 (now part of the museum) was home to a musician cut from a different piece of musical cloth: American guitarist Jimi Hendrix (1942–70), who lived there from 1968 until his death in Ladbroke Grove. A blue plaque on the exterior attests to his residency; the flat he lived in is currenly being authentically restored and will be open in 2016.  	11am-6pm Mon-Sat, noon-6pm Sun	[]		http://handelhendrix.org	False	False		joint Handel & Hendrix ticket adult/child £10/5 or £7.50/3 for entry to either Handel House or Hendrix Flat	['Museum']	[]	-0.145944	51.513003			[]	25 Brook St		False			[]

It was once a duelling ground and, like Hyde Park, served as a vegetable garden during WWII.	It famously has no flower beds as they were banned by Queen Catherine of Braganza after she learned her philandering husband Charles II had been picking posies for his mistresses.

Burlington Arcade	england	london	activity	Flanking Burlington House, home to the Royal Academy of Arts, is this delightful arcade, built in 1819. Today it is a shopping precinct for the wealthy, and is most famous for the Burlington Berties, uniformed guards who patrol the area keeping an eye out for such offences as running, chewing gum, whistling, opening umbrellas or anything else that could lower the tone (that the arcade once served as a brothel is kept quiet).	Running perpendicular to it between Old Bond and Albermarle streets is the more recent (1880) Royal Arcade.	9am-7.30pm Mon-Sat, 11am-6pm Sun	['11:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 43:00', '58:00 - 67:00', '82:00 - 91:00', '106:00 - 115:00', '130:00 - 139:00', '153:00 - 162:30']		http://www.burlington-arcade.co.uk	False	False			['Historic Building']	['Flea & Street Markets', 'Shopping']	-0.13955	51.508435	5.0	4.0	['48', '44', '15', '1', '0']	51 Piccadilly	51 Piccadilly, , London, W1J 0QJ	True	264		[]
Banqueting House	england	london	activity	After the Holbein Gate was demolished in 1759, this is the sole surviving part of the Tudor Whitehall Palace (1532) that once stretched most of the way down Whitehall before going skywards in a 1698 conflagration. Designed by Inigo Jones in 1622 and controversially refaced in Portland stone in the 19th century, Banqueting House was England’s first purely Renaissance building and resembled no other structure in the country at the time. The English apparently loathed it for over a century.	A bust outside commemorates 30 January 1649, when Charles I, accused of treason by Oliver Cromwell after the Civil War, was executed on a scaffold built against a 1st-floor window here. When the monarchy was reinstated with his son, Charles II, it inevitably became something of a royalist shrine. Look to the clock tower opposite at Horse Guards Parade. The number 2 (the time of the execution) is blacked out. In a huge, virtually unfurnished hall on the 1st floor there are nine ceiling panels painted by Peter Paul Rubens in 1635. They were commissioned by Charles I and celebrate the 'benefits of wise rule' and the Union of England and Scotland Act (1603).Tickets are cheaper if you buy online. Call ahead or check the closure schedule online as Banqueting House occasionally shuts at 1pm for functions and events.	10am-5pm	['34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']		http://www.hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse	False	False	90	adult/child £6.60/free	['Palace']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Historic Sites', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.125999	51.504636	5.0	4.0	['114', '99', '37', '12', '4']	Whitehall	Whitehall Palace Whitehall, , London, SW1A 2ER	True	211		[]

Chelsea Physic Garden	england	london	activity	This walled pocket of botanical enchantment was established by the Apothecaries’ Society in 1673 for students working on medicinal plants and healing. One of Europe’s oldest of its kind, the small grounds are a compendium of botany, from carnivorous pitcher plants to rich yellow flag irises, a cork oak from Portugal, the largest outdoor fruiting olive tree in the British Isles, rare trees and shrubs. The site, not far from the river, ensures a slightly warmer microclimate to protect nonnative plants.	The fascinating pharmaceutical garden grows plants used in contemporary Western medicine; the Garden of World Medicine has a selection of plants used by indigenous peoples in Australia, China, India, New Zealand and North America. There’s also a heady perfume and aromatherapy garden plus a fine cafe; enter from Swan Walk.

Kensington Gardens	england	london	activity	Kensington Gardens is a gorgeous collection of manicured lawns, tree-shaded avenues and basins immediately west of Hyde Park. The picturesque 107-hectare expanse is technically part of Kensington Palace, located in the far west of the gardens.The large Round Pond is enjoyable to amble around and also worth a look are the lovely fountains in the Italian Gardens, believed to be a gift from Albert to Queen Victoria.	The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground, in the northwest corner of the gardens, has some pretty ambitious attractions for children. Next to the playground stands the delightful Elfin Oak, a 900-year-old tree stump carved with elves, gnomes, witches and small creatures. George Frampton’s celebrated Peter Pan statue is close to the lake, while the astonishing Albert Memorial is in the south of Kensington Gardens, facing the Royal Albert Hall.	6am-dusk	['6:00 - 20:00', '30:00 - 44:00', '54:00 - 68:00', '78:00 - 92:00', '102:00 - 116:00', '126:00 - 140:00', '150:00 - 164:00']		http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington-gardens	False	False	30		['Park']	['Gardens', 'Nature & Parks']	-0.188603798036	51.5081907833	5.5	4.5	['1002', '477', '64', '8', '5']		The Magazine Storeyard, , London, W2 UH	True	38	30	[]
Wellington Arch	england	london	activity	Dominating the green space throttled by the Hyde Park Corner roundabout, this imposing neoclassical 1826 arch originally faced the Hyde Park Screen, but was shunted here in 1882 for road widening. Once a police station, it is now a gallery with temporary exhibitions and a permanent display about the history of the arch. The open-air balconies (accessible by lift) afford unforgettable views of Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace and the Mall.	Originally crowned by a disproportionately large equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington (which now stands in Aldershot in Hamsphire), it was replaced by the current four-horse Peace Descending on the Quadriga of War in 1912, Europe’s largest bronze sculpture. At the time of writing the lift was out of action, but it should be up and running by the time you read this.	10am-6pm Apr-Sep, to 4pm Nov-Mar	['10:00 - 16:00', '82:00 - 88:00', '106:00 - 112:00', '130:00 - 136:00', '154:00 - 160:00']		http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/wellington-arch	False	False	90	adult/child £4.70/2.80, with Apsley House £10.50/6.30	['Museum']	['Monuments & Statues', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.150879621506	51.5024784617	4.0	4.0	['95', '134', '51', '4', '1']	Hyde Park Corner	Hyde Park, , London, W2 2UH	False	193		[]
Royal Hospital Chelsea	england	london	activity	Designed by Christopher Wren, this superb structure was built in 1692 to provide shelter for ex-servicemen. Since the reign of Charles II it has housed hundreds of war veterans, known as Chelsea Pensioners. They’re fondly regarded as national treasures, and cut striking figures in the dark-blue greatcoats (in winter) or scarlet frock coats (in summer) that they wear on ceremonial occasions.	The museum contains a huge collection of war medals bequeathed by former residents and plenty of information about the institution's history and its residents. Visitors can also peek at the hospital’s Great Hall refectory, Octagon Porch, chapel and courtyards. Chelsea Pensioner–led tours are also available (adult/child £12/7).Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is buried here, in the old cemetery.

No 10 Downing Street	england	london	activity	The official office of British leaders since 1732, when George II presented No 10 to Robert Walpole, this has also been the prime minister’s London residence since refurbishment in 1902. For such a famous address, No 10 is a small-looking Georgian building on a plain-looking street, hardly warranting comparison with the White House, for example. Yet it is actually three houses joined into one and boasts roughly 100 rooms plus a 2000-sq-metre garden with a lovely L-shaped lawn.	The street was cordoned off with a rather large iron gate during Margaret Thatcher’s time, so you won’t see much. After an IRA mortar attack in 1991, the stout wooden door was replaced with a blast-proof steel version (which cannot be opened from the outside).

Piccadilly Circus	england	london	activity	John Nash had originally designed Regent St and Piccadilly in the 1820s to be the two most elegant streets in town but, curbed by city planners, couldn’t realise his dream to the full. He may be disappointed, but suitably astonished, with Piccadilly Circus today: a traffic maelstrom, deluged with visitors and flanked by flashing advertisement panels. ‘It’s like Piccadilly Circus’, as the expression goes, but it's certainly fun.	Piccadilly Circus has become a postcard for the city, buzzing with the liveliness that makes it exciting to be in London. 'Piccadilly' was named in the 17th century for the stiff collars (picadils) that were the sartorial staple of the time (and were the making of a nearby tailor’s fortune), while 'Circus' comes from the Latin word meaning ring or circle.At the centre of the circus stands the famous aluminium statue, Anteros, twin brother of Eros, dedicated to the philanthropist and child-labour abolitionist Lord Shaftesbury. Named The Angel of Christian Charity, the sculpture was at first cast in gold, but was later replaced by newfangled aluminium, the first outdoor statue in the lightweight metal. Through the years, the figure has been mistaken for Eros, the God of Love, and the misnomer has stuck (you’ll even see signs for ‘Eros’ from the Underground).

Chinatown	england	london	activity	Immediately north of Leicester Sq – but a world away in atmosphere – are Lisle and Gerrard streets, a focal point for London’s growing Chinese community. Although not as big as Chinatowns in many other cities – it’s just two streets really – this is a lively quarter with oriental gates, Chinese street signs, red lanterns, restaurants, great Asian supermarkets and shops. The quality of food varies enormously, but there's a good choice of places for dim sum and other cuisine from across China.	To see it at its effervescent best, time your visit for Chinese New Year in late January/early February. Twenty years ago you would only hear Cantonese but these days you'll hear Mandarin and other dialects, from places as far afield as Fújiàn, Sìchuān and Shànghǎi.

St James's Palace	england	london	activity	The striking Tudor gatehouse of St James’s Palace (not open to the public, but you can admire it from the outside), the only surviving part of a building initiated by the palace-mad Henry VIII in 1530, is best approached from St James’s St to the north of St James’s Park. The official residence of kings and queens for more than three centuries, the palace remains the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II, although she elects to reside in Buckingham Palace.	Foreign ambassadors are still formally accredited to the Court of St James, although they are actually received at Buckingham Palace. Princess Diana, who hated this place, lived here until her divorce from Charles in 1996, when she moved to Kensington Palace. Prince Charles and his sons stayed on at St James’s until 2004, before decamping next door to Clarence House, leaving St James’s Palace as the London residence of his sister Anne, the Princess Royal, and nieces the Princesses Beatrix and Eugenie. The palace was built on the grounds of a famous leper hospital.

Westminster Cathedral	england	london	activity	With its distinctive candy-striped red-brick and white-stone tower features, John Francis Bentley’s 19th-century cathedral, the mother church of Roman Catholicism in England and Wales, is a splendid example of neo-Byzantine architecture. Although construction started here in 1896 and worshippers began attending services seven years later, the church ran out of money and the gaunt interior remains largely unfinished, although some radiant mosaics dazzle from the gloom.	The application of colour is a painfully slow process. The Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament and elsewhere are ablaze with Eastern Roman mosaics and ornamented with 100 types of marble; the arched ceiling of the Lady Chapel is also richly presented, while other areas of the church remain just bare brick.The highly regarded stone bas-reliefs of the Stations of the Cross (1918) by Eric Gill and the marvellously sombre atmosphere make this a welcome haven from the traffic outside. The views from viewing gallery 64m up in the 83m-tall bell tower – thankfully, accessible by lift – are impressive.

Queen's House	england	london	activity	The first Palladian building by architect Inigo Jones after he returned from Italy is as enticing for its form as for its art collection. The Great Hall is a lovely cube shape with an elaborately tiled floor. Climb the beautiful helix-shaped Tulip Stairs up to the 1st floor, where there's a rich collection of paintings and portraits with a sea or seafaring theme from the National Maritime Museum's collection.

Greenwich Park	england	london	activity	This is one of London’s loveliest expanses of green, with a rose garden, picturesque walks, Anglo-Saxon tumuli and astonishing views from the crown of the hill near the Royal Observatory towards Canary Wharf – the financial district across the Thames. Covering 74 hectares, it's the oldest enclosed royal park and is partly the work of André Le Nôtre, the landscape architect who designed the palace gardens of Versailles. Greenwich Park hosted the 2012 Olympic Games equestrian events.	The park contains a lovely teahouse near the Royal Observatory, a cafe behind the National Maritime Museum, a deer park, tennis courts in the southwest and a boating lake at the Queen’s House end.	6am-6pm winter, to 8pm spring & autumn, to 9pm summer	['6:00 - 21:00', '30:00 - 45:00', '54:00 - 69:00', '78:00 - 93:00', '102:00 - 117:00', '126:00 - 141:00', '150:00 - 165:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/c0ae30c056edf571406066c5ac3b2043-greenwich-park.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.royalparks.org.uk	False	False	90		['Park']	['Nature & Parks']	0.001620054245	51.4767389578	5.5	4.5	['746', '328', '40', '2', '3']	King George St	Greenwich Park, , London, SE10 8QY	True	43		[]
30 St Mary Axe	england	london	activity	Nicknamed 'the Gherkin' for its unusual shape, 30 St Mary Axe is arguably the City's most distinctive skyscraper, dominating the skyline despite actually being slightly smaller than the neighbouring NatWest Tower. Built in 2003 by award-winning Norman Foster, the Gherkin’s futuristic exterior has become an emblem of modern London – as recognisable as Big Ben and the London Eye.	The building is closed to the public, though in the past it has opened its doors over the Open House London weekend in September.

London Canal Museum	england	london	activity	This little museum traces the history of the Regent’s Canal and explores what life was like for families living and working on Britain's impressively long and historic canal system. The exhibits in the stables upstairs are dedicated to the history of canal transport in Britain, with a fascinating 1925 film of a journey along the Regent's Canal. The museum is housed in a warehouse dating from 1858, where ice was once stored in two deep wells.	The ice trade was huge in Victorian London, with 35,000 tonnes imported from Norway in 1899 alone, arriving in the city at Regent's Canal Dock before being transported along the canal.

This large, light cruiser – launched in 1938 – served in WWII, helping to sink the German battleship Scharnhorst, shelling the Normandy coast on D Day and later participated in the Korean War. Its 6in guns could bombard a target 14 land miles distant. Displays offer a great insight into what life on board was like, in peace times and during military engagements.

St Katharine Docks	england	london	activity	Sitting in the shadow of Tower Bridge, this once-booming part of London's Docklands was built in 1828 by engineer-extraordinaire Thomas Telford. To make way for it, 1250 'insanitary' houses were razed and 11,300 people made homeless. The dock was badly bombed during WWII and was finally abandoned altogether in 1968. Its current incarnation, as a marina for luxury yachts, surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and twee shops, dates from the 1980s.	It's the perfect starting point for a stroll along the Thames Path to Wapping and Limehouse.

Abbey Road Studios	england	london	activity	Beatles aficionados can't possibly visit London without making a pilgrimage to this famous recording studio in St John's Wood. The studios themselves are off limits, so you'll have to content yourself with examining the decades of fans' graffiti on the fence outside. Stop-start local traffic is long accustomed to groups of tourists lining up on the zebra crossing to reenact the cover of the fab four's 1969 masterpiece Abbey Road. In 2010 the crossing was rewarded with Grade II heritage status.	For a strangely engrossing real-time view of the crossing, hit the 'live' tab for the webcam on the studio's website; you can even find your own crossing shot by punching in your time. To reach Abbey Road Studios take the tube to St John's Wood, cross the road, follow Grove End Rd to its end and turn right. Don't do what some disappointed fans do and head to Abbey Rd station in West Ham, no relation of the true site and miles off-course (there are indeed at least 10 Abbey Rds in London, adding to the tourist confusion).

Strand	england	london	activity	Built in the 12th century, the Strand (from the Old English word for 'shore'; 'stranded' has the same etymology) runs by the Thames. Over the centuries its grandiose stone houses counted as some of the most prestigious places to live, sitting as they did on a street that connected the City and Westminster. Some of these buildings are now the Savoy Hotel, Simpson’s, King’s College and Somerset House, but modern times have added offices, cheap restaurants and souvenir shops.	Other interesting addresses include Twinings at No 216 – a teashop opened by Thomas Twining in 1706 and thought to be the oldest company in the capital still trading on the same site and owned by the same family – and the stamp- and coin-collectors’ mecca Stanley Gibbons at No 339. TS Eliot refers to the road in his seminal 1922 poem The Waste Land: '"This music crept by me upon the waters" And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street'.

When Victoria Park opened in 1845 it was the first public park in the East End, given the go-ahead after a local MP presented Queen Victoria with a petition of 30,000 signatures.	It quickly gained a reputation as the 'People's Park' when many large political rallies were held here. During WWII the park was largely closed to the public and was used as a base for antiaircraft guns and as an internment camp for Italian and then German prisoners of war.	7am-dusk	[]		http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/victoriapark	False	False	90		['Park']	['Nature & Parks']	-0.04004	51.536059	5.5	4.5	['67', '43', '6', '1', '0']	Grove Rd	Old Ford Road, , London	True	217		[]
Regent's Canal	england	london	activity	To escape the crowded streets and enjoy a picturesque, waterside angle on North London, take to the canals that once played such a vital role in the transport of goods across the capital. The towpath of the Regent's Canal also makes an excellent shortcut across North London, either on foot or by bike. In full, the ribbon of water runs nine miles from Little Venice (where it connects with the Grand Union Canal) to the Thames at Limehouse.	You can however make do with walking from Little Venice to Camden Town in less than an hour, passing Regent's Park and London Zoo, as well as beautiful villas designed by architect John Nash and redevelopments of old industrial buildings. Allow 25 to 30 minutes between Little Venice and Regent's Park, and 15 to 20 minutes between Regent's Park and Camden Town. There are plenty of well-signed exits along the way.If you decide to continue on, it's worth stopping at the London Canal Museum in King’s Cross to learn more about the canal's history. Shortly afterwards you'll hit the 878m-long Islington Tunnel and have to take to the roads for a spell. After joining it again near Colebrooke Row, you can follow the water all the way to the Thames at Limehouse Basin, or divert on to the Hertford Union Canal at Victoria Park and head to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.

Guildhall	england	london	activity	Bang in the centre of the Square Mile, Guildhall has been the City’s seat of government for more than 800 years. The present building dates from the early 15th century, making it the only existing secular stone structure to have survived the Great Fire of 1666, although it was severely damaged both then and during the Blitz of 1940.	Check in at reception to visit the impressive Great Hall, where you can see the banners and shields of London’s 12 principal livery companies, or guilds, which used to wield absolute power throughout the city. The lord mayor and two sheriffs are still elected annually in the vast open hall. Among the monuments to look out for are statues of Winston Churchill, Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder. In the upper gallery, at the western end, are statues of the biblical giants Gog and Magog, traditionally considered to be guardians of the City – today’s figures replaced similar 18th-century statues destroyed in the Blitz. The Guildhall’s stained glass was also blown out during the Blitz, but a modern window in the southwestern corner depicts the city’s history – look out for a picture of London’s most famous lord mayor, Richard ‘Dick’ Whittington, with his famous cat, a scene of the Great Fire and even the Lloyd's of London building.

The Temple Church has a distinctive design and is in two parts: the Round (consecrated in 1185 and modelled after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem) adjoins the Chancel (built in 1240), which is the heart of the modern church. Both parts were severely damaged by a bomb in 1941 and have been completely reconstructed. Its most obvious points of interest are the life-size stone effigies of nine 13th-century knights lying on the floor of the Round. Some of them are cross-legged, but contrary to popular belief this doesn't necessarily mean they were crusaders. It's one of just four round churches left in England. The church is only open to tourists from Monday to Friday, but services are held on Sundays.	10am-4pm Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri, 2-4pm Wed, hours & days can vary	[]		http://www.templechurch.com	False	False	90	adult/child £5/free	['Church']	['Churches & Cathedrals', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.110228	51.513196	5.5	4.5	['144', '76', '5', '3', '3']		The Temple, , London, EC4Y 7BB	True	116		[]
Dr Johnson's House	england	london	activity	This wonderful house, built in 1700, is a rare surviving example of a Georgian mansion in the City. It was the home of the great Georgian wit Samuel Johnson, the author of the first serious dictionary of the English language and the man who famously proclaimed, ‘When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life’.	The house contains antique furniture and artefacts from Dr Johnson’s life, including a chair from his local pub, the Old Cock Tavern on Fleet St, and numerous paintings of the lexographer and his associates, including his black manservant Francis Barber and his clerk and biographer James Boswell.On the upper floors there are leaflets describing how Dr Johnson and six clerks (Boswell wasn’t among them yet) developed the first English dictionary in the house’s attic during the period he lived here from 1748–59, as well as a copy of the first edition of the dictionary from 1755. Children will love the Georgian dress-up clothes, and there are also temporary exhibits.	11am-5.30pm Mon-Sat May-Sep, to 5pm Oct-Apr	['35:00 - 41:30', '59:00 - 65:30', '83:00 - 89:30', '107:00 - 113:30', '131:00 - 137:30', '155:00 - 161:30']		http://www.drjohnsonshouse.org	False	False	90	adult/child £6/2.50, audio guide £2	['Museum']	['Historic Sites', 'History Museums', 'Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.108039	51.514625	5.5	4.5	['59', '45', '13', '1', '2']	17 Gough Sq	17 Gough Square, , London, EC4A 3DE	True	340	90	[]

Richmond Park	england	london	activity	At almost 1000 hectares (the largest urban parkland in Europe), this park offers everything from formal gardens and ancient oaks to unsurpassed views of central London 12 miles away. It’s easy to flee the several roads slicing up the rambling wilderness, making the park perfect for a quiet walk or a picnic with the kids, even in summer when Richmond’s riverside heaves. Coming from Richmond, it’s easiest to enter via Richmond Gate or from Petersham Rd.	Herds of more than 600 red and fallow deer basking under the trees are part of its magic, but they can be less than docile in rutting season (September and October) and when the does bear young (May to July), so keep your distance (over 50m) during these times. Birdwatchers will love the diverse habitats, from neat gardens to woodland and assorted ponds.

Charles Dickens Museum	england	london	activity	A £3.5 million renovation made this museum, located in a handsome four-storey house that was the great Victorian novelist's sole surviving residence in London, bigger and better than ever. A period kitchen in the basement and a nursery in the attic were added, and newly acquired 49 Doughty St increased the exhibition space substantially.	Not that the prolific writer stayed here very long – a mere 2½ years (1837–39) – but this is where his work really flourished: he dashed off The Pickwick Papers, Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist, despite anxiety over debts, the death of his beloved sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, and his ever-growing family. The house was saved from demolition and the museum opened in 1925, showcasing the family drawing room (restored to its original condition) and a dozen rooms containing various memorabilia, including the study where you'll find the desk at which Dickens wrote Great Expectations. The charming and wi-fi-equipped garden cafe (open 10am to 4.30pm from Tuesday to Sunday) is free to visit, without requiring admission to the museum.

There’s also a pretty and recently restored walled garden (10.15am to 4.15pm summer, to 3.45pm winter) and, detached from the main house, a Tudor Revival chapel designed by William Butterfield in 1866.There are two permanent displays inside the palace relating the history of the building and its inhabitants. Guided tours (£6, 1½ hours, four to five tours per month) usually take in the Great Hall, the Victorian chapel, Bishop Sherlock’s Room and the Dining Room. There are also garden walks (£6, 1¼ hours); check the website for dates and times. The lawn is also a venue for Luna Cinema, the popular summer outdoor-cinema club that shows films at famous spots around town and the UK; summer jazz evenings are also staged.The surrounding land, once totalling almost 15 hectares but now reduced to just over five, forms Bishop’s Park, a beautiful park with a lovely promenade along the river and the usual assortment of playgrounds, fountains and cafe. Tours (£6) also take in the park.	palace 12.30-4.30pm Mon-Thu, noon-5pm Sun summer, slightly earlier hours in winter, gardens dawn-dusk daily	['9:00 - 17:00', '33:00 - 41:00', '57:00 - 65:00', '81:00 - 89:00', '105:00 - 113:00', '129:00 - 137:00', '153:00 - 161:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/mastheads/GettyImages-148601066_full.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.fulhampalace.org	False	False	90		['Historic Building']	['Historic Sites', 'History Museums', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Museums']	-0.215542316437	51.4705708095	5.0	4.0	['29', '29', '7', '1', '1']	Bishop's Ave	Fulham Palace Bishops Avenue, , London, SW6 6EA	True	427		[]
Shard	england	london	activity	Puncturing the skies above London, the dramatic splinter-like form of the Shard has rapidly become an icon of London. The viewing platforms on floors 68, 69 and 72 are open to the public and the views are, as you'd expect from a 244m vantage point, sweeping, but they come at a hefty price – book online at least a day in advance to save £5.	Audio guides in 11 languages are available. To take in the view for less, visit one of the building's restaurants or bars; you'll pay less than half the viewing platform ticket price for breakfast or a cocktail at Aqua Shard or Oblix where the views are still spectacular. If you choose Gǒng for a drink, be aware there is a £30 minimum spend per person.	10am-10pm	['10:00 - 18:30', '34:00 - 42:30', '58:00 - 66:30', '82:00 - 90:30', '106:00 - 117:30', '130:00 - 141:30', '154:00 - 165:30']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/d26f526924e92b16ccf7dfffe49745ea-shard.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.theviewfromtheshard.com	False	False	90	adult/child £30.95/24.95	['Notable Building']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Observation Decks & Towers', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-0.086668	51.504235	5.5	4.5	['5043', '2857', '1094', '275', '181']	32 London Bridge St	Joiner Street, , London, SE1	True	42	90	[]

The museum has a fantastic permanent collection that it struggled to showcase in its former Thames location, so it moved to new premises in Kensington at the tail end of 2016. And of course, it picked a design jewel: the former Commonwealth Institute building, a listed 1960s beauty, which was given a 21st-century facelift for the occasion.	10am-5.45pm	[]		http://www.designmuseum.org	False	False	90		['Museum']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	-0.199385	51.499086			[]	224-238 Kensington High St	28 Shad Thames, , London, W8 6AG	False		90	[]

Arabica Bar & Kitchen	england	london	restaurant	Pan Middle-Eastern cuisine is a well-rehearsed classic these days, but Arabica Bar  Kitchen has managed to bring something fresh to its table: the decor is contemporary and bright, the food delicate and light, with an emphasis on sharing (two to three small dishes per person).

The Gun	england	london	restaurant	Set at the end of a residential street that somehow survived the Blitz, this early 18th-century riverside pub has been seriously dolled up, but still manages to ooze history.

Rough Luxe Hotel	england	london	hotel	Half-rough, half-luxury is the strapline of this nine-room hotel, and the distressed interior is true to its word. Scraps of old newspaper adorn the walls, along with original artwork, while the vintage 1970s TVs are for show only. Some rooms are admittedly small but service, location and the delightful patio garden at the back more than make up for it.	Each room is different; the cheapest come with shared bathroom, while the priciest double has a free-standing copper bathtub.

Stylotel	england	london	hotel	The crisp industrial design – scored aluminium treads, opaque green glass, riveted stainless steel, metal bed frames – of this 40-room niche hotel is contemporary and well-priced. Elbow room is at a premium: 'stylorooms' are small, but the largely carpet-free floor surfaces help keep things dapper. The eight more spacious 'stylosuites' above the Sussex Arms around the corner are more swish.	Free tea and coffee in the lounge.

The Walrus Hostel	england	london	hotel	This little hostel gets top marks for trying so hard (and succeeding!) at making a welcoming, individual, friendly and cosy hostel in the big smoke. The corridors and stairs are on the shabby side but the dorms (sleeping four to 22) and bathrooms are spick and span. The downside is the noise from the street and railway, but at this price...	The vintage kitchen is fun, as is the tip-top shabby-chic pub downstairs, which is just as popular with the locals as it is with hostel residents (who get 15% off all drinks).
