usa	san-francisco	Exploratorium	Is there a science to skateboarding? Do toilets really flush counterclockwise in Australia? Find answers to questions you wished you'd learned in school, at San Francisco's thrilling hands-on science museum. Combining science with art, and investigating human perception, the Exploratorium nudges you to question how you perceive the world around you. As thrilling as the exhibits is the setting: a nine-acre, glass-walled pier jutting straight into San Francisco Bay, with large outdoor portions you can explore free of charge, twenty-four hours a day.Covering a whopping 330,000 sq feet of indoor-outdoor space, galleries focus on color, sound, light and motion, stimulating learning by inviting participation. Never didactic, always engaging, the over-600 exhibits have buttons to push, cranks to ratchet, and dials to adjust, all tinkered together by artists and scientists at the in-house building shop (which you can peer into). Try on a punk hairdo, courtesy of the static-electricity station. Turn your body into the gnomon of a sun-dial. Slide, climb and feel your way – in total darkness – through the labyrinth of the thrilling Tactile Dome (reservations and separate ticket required). Frank Oppenheimer founded the Exploratorium in 1969. He'd been a physicist on the atom bomb, was blackballed during the McCarthy era, then later reemerged as a high-school teacher, eschewing secret scientific study in favor of public education. The Exploratorium is his lasting legacy, with the mission to incorporate technology with human values. In 2013 the Exploratorium moved from the Marina to Pier 15, a brand-new solar-powered space, built in concert with scientific agencies, including NOAA, which hard-wired the entire pier with sensors delivering real-time data on weather, wind, tides, and the bay. See the data flow in at your final stop, the Observatory Gallery, a glass-enclosed lookout where you can make your own observations about sea, land and sky. 	150	-122.398177	37.801146	5.5	1078	362	111	22	3	4.5	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00', '114:00 - 118:00']	['Science Museums', "Children's Museums", 'Museums']	True	activity

usa	san-francisco	Balmy Alley	Inspired by Diego Rivera's 1930s San Francisco murals and outraged by US foreign policy in Central America, Mission artists set out in the 1970s to transform the political landscape, one mural-covered garage door at a time. Balmy Alley brought personal perspectives to international events, with Mujeres Muralistas (Women Muralists) and Placa ('mark-making') transforming back-alley fences into a united artistic front.Today, a one-block walk down Balmy Alley leads past three decades of murals, from an early memorial for El Salvador activist Archbishop Óscar Romero to an homage to Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keefe and other pioneering women modern artists. Precita Eyes restores these murals, commissions new ones by San Francisco artists and runs muralist-led tours that cover 50 to 70 Mission murals within an eight-block radius of Balmy Alley. On November 1, the annual Mission parade Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) begins here.	90	-122.41236	37.751838	5.5	28	12	4	2	0	4.5	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity

usa	san-francisco	Alcatraz	Alcatraz: for almost 150 years, the name has given the innocent chills and the guilty cold sweats. Over the years it’s been the nation’s first military prison, a forbidding maximum-security penitentiary and disputed territory between Native American activists and the FBI. No wonder that first step you take off the ferry and onto ‘the Rock’ seems to cue ominous music: dunh-dunh-dunnnnh!It all started innocently enough back in 1775, when Spanish lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala sailed the San Carlos past the 12-acre island he called Isla de Alcatraces (Isle of the Pelicans). In 1859 a new post on Alcatraz became the first US West Coast fort, and soon proved handy as a holding pen for Civil War deserters, insubordinates and those who had been court-martialed. Among the prisoners were Native American scouts and ‘unfriendlies, ’ including 19 Hopis who refused to send their children to government boarding schools where speaking Hopi and practicing their religion were punishable by beatings. By 1902 the four cell blocks of wooden cages were rotting, unsanitary and otherwise ill-equipped for the influx of US soldiers convicted of war crimes in the Philippines. The army began building a new concrete military prison in 1909, but upkeep was expensive and the US soon had other things to worry about: WWI, financial ruin and flappers. When the 18th Amendment to the Constitution declared selling liquor a crime in 1922, rebellious Jazz Agers weren’t prepared to give up their tipple – and gangsters kept the booze coming. Authorities were determined to make a public example of criminal ringleaders, and in 1934 the Federal Bureau of Prisons took over Alcatraz as a prominent showcase for its crime-fighting efforts. ‘The Rock’ averaged only 264 inmates, but its roster read like an America’s Most Wanted list. A-list criminals doing time on Alcatraz included Chicago crime boss Al ‘Scarface’ Capone, dapper kidnapper George ‘Machine Gun’ Kelly, hot-headed Harlem mafioso and sometime poet ‘Bumpy’ Johnson, and Morton Sobell, the military contractor found guilty of Soviet espionage along with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Today, first-person accounts of daily life in the Alcatraz lockup are included on the award-winning audio tour provided by Alcatraz Cruises. But take your headphones off for just a moment, and notice the sound of carefree city life traveling across the water: this is the torment that made perilous escapes into rip tides worth the risk. Though Alcatraz was considered escape-proof, in 1962 the Anglin brothers and Frank Morris floated away on a makeshift raft and were never seen again. Security and upkeep proved prohibitively expensive, and finally the island prison was abandoned to the birds in 1963. Native Americans claimed sovereignty over the island in the ’60s, noting that Alcatraz had long been used by the Ohlone as a spiritual retreat, yet federal authorities refused their proposal to turn Alcatraz into a Native American study center. Then on the eve of Thanksgiving, 1969, 79 Native American activists broke a Coast Guard blockade to enforce their claim. Over the next 19 months, some 5600 Native Americans would visit the occupied island. Public support eventually pressured President Richard Nixon to restore Native territory and strengthen self-rule for Native nations in 1970. Each Thanksgiving Day since 1975, an ‘Un-Thanksgiving’ ceremony has been held at dawn on Alcatraz, with Native leaders and supporters showing their determination to reverse the course of colonial history. After the government regained control of the island, it became a national park, and by 1973 had already become a major draw. Today the cell blocks, ‘This Is Indian Land’ water-tower graffiti and rare wildlife are all part of the attraction. 	150	-122.422932344	37.8267848359	4.5	17165	5116	849	142	103	4.5	[]	['Islands', 'Nature & Wildlife Areas', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	san-francisco	Mission Dolores	The city's oldest building and its namesake, whitewashed adobe Misión San Francisco de Asís was founded in 1776 and rebuilt in 1782 with conscripted Ohlone and Miwok labor – note the ceiling patterned after native baskets. Recent restorations revealed a hidden mural behind the altar painted by Ohlone artisans: a sacred heart, pierced by a sword and dripping with blood.The building's nickname, Mission Dolores (Mission of the Sorrows), was taken from a nearby lake but it turned out to be tragically apt. With harsh living conditions and little resistance to introduced diseases, some 5000 Ohlone and Miwok died in mission measles epidemics in 1814 and 1826. In the cemetery beside the adobe mission, a replica Ohlone hut commemorates their mass burial in the graveyard, among early Mexican and European settlers.Surrounding the Ohlone memorial, you'll notice graves dating from the Gold Rush. Alongside mission founders are buried Don Luis Antonio Arguello, the first governor of Alta California under Mexican rule, and Don Francisco de Haro, the first mayor of San Francisco. Hitchcock fans looking for the grave of Carlotta Valdes will be disappointed: the tomb was only a prop for the film Vertigo .Today the modest adobe mission is overshadowed by the adjoining ornate Churrigueresque basilica, built in 1913 after an 1876 brick Gothic cathedral collapsed in the 1906 earthquake. The front doors are usually only open during services, so you'll need to pass through the original adobe mission structure and cross a courtyard to enter a side door.Your eyes may take a moment to adjust once you're inside, because most of the light is filtered through the basilica's splendid stained-glass windows. The choir windows show St Francis beaming beatifically against an orange background, and lower windows along the nave feature the 21 California missions from Santa Cruz to San Diego and mission builders Father Junípero Serra and Father Francisco Palou. True to Mission Dolores' name, seven panels depict the Seven Sorrows of Mary: one above the main door and three on each of the side balconies.	90	-122.426853	37.76445	5.5	62	67	16	0	1	4.5	['9:00 - 16:00', '33:00 - 40:00', '57:00 - 64:00', '81:00 - 88:00', '105:00 - 112:00', '129:00 - 136:00', '153:00 - 160:00']	['Historic Sites', 'Missions', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	san-francisco	City Hall	That mighty beaux arts dome pretty much covers San Francisco's grandest ambitions and fundamental flaws. Designed in 1915 to outdo Paris for flair and outsize the capitol in Washington, DC, the dome – the world's fifth largest – was unsteady until its retrofit after the 1989 earthquake, when ingenious technology enabled it to swing on its base without raising alarm. The gold leafing on the dome's exterior is a reminder of dot-com-era excess. But from the inside, the splendid rotunda has ringing acoustics, and if that dome could talk, it would tell of triumph and tragedy. Anti-McCarthy sit-in protesters were hosed off the grand staircase in 1960 but finally ran McCarthy out of town. Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated here in 1978. And in 2004, cheers rang around the world for families and friends of the 4037 same-sex couples who celebrated their marriages here, thanks to Mayor Newsom's short-lived challenge to California marriage law (the latter overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013). Take the elevator one flight down to discover intriguing public art exhibitions, which range from photographs of senior subcultures to work by blind artists.Free docent-led tours meet at the tour kiosk near the Van Ness Ave entrance, but City Hall is best seen in action. For insight into how San Francisco government works – or doesn't – the Board of Supervisors meets Tuesdays at 2pm in City Hall; check the agenda and minutes online.

usa	san-francisco	George Sterling Park	'Homeward into the sunset/Still unwearied we go/Till the northern hills are misty/With the amber of afterglow.' Poet George Sterling's City by the Sea is almost maudlin – that is, until you watch the sunset over the Golden Gate Bridge from his namesake hilltop park. Sterling was a great romancer of all San Francisco offered – nature, idealism, free love and opium – and was frequently broke. But as toast of the secretive, elite Bohemian Club, San Francisco's high society indulged the poet in his eccentricities, which included carrying a lethal dose of cyanide as a reminder of life's transience. Broken by his ex-wife's suicide and loss of his best friend, novelist Jack London, the 'King of Bohemia' apparently took this bitter dose in 1926 inside his apartment at the club. Afterward, his influential friends named this park – with zigzagging paths and stirring, Sterling views – for him.If you're not breathless from these hilltop vistas, play tennis on the adjacent public court named after San Francisco's Alice Marble, the 1930s tennis champ who recovered from tuberculosis to win Wimbledon and serve during WWII as a US secret agent among Nazis.

For more on Milk, wander down the Muni-metro stairs to see text and images of his life. Jane Warner was a much-loved lesbian police officer. Compared with loud-mouth Harvey, Jane was modest – which makes it doubly ironic that in 2012 her namesake plaza attracted international attention for public nudity. Several flagrant exhibitionists lollygagged here dawn till dusk, casually splaying their legs at oncoming traffic. Their passive-aggressive behavior incited such outcry that public nudity in SF was eventually dubbed illegal – but not a sex crime, just an infraction. Now it's legal to strip only at a handful of public events, like Folsom Street Fair. You can still sometimes spot the 'naked guys' at the plaza, only now they wear socks on their penises, posing for pictures with tourists by F-Market trains.		None	None	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	san-francisco	Transamerica Pyramid & Redwood Park	The defining feature of San Francisco's skyline was built during the Jet Age, atop the wreck of a whaling ship abandoned in the 1849 Gold Rush, at the site of a saloon frequented by Mark Twain and the newspaper office where Sun Yat-sen drafted his Proclamation of the Republic of China. Architect William Pereira maximized light in the narrow streets below with his pyramid design, but even before its 1972 inauguration his pointy office tower was derided as Pereira's Prick. Critics claimed Pereira's Hollywood special-effects background was too apparent in the 853ft streamlined tower, which looked ready for blastoff. But others found the quirky landmark perfectly suited to SF. Even the haters love Redwood Park, the half-acre redwood stand beneath the Pyramid.Another redeeming feature was the view – note, past tense.

The parrots keep their distance in the treetops, but like anyone else in North Beach, they can probably be bribed into friendship with a focaccia from Liguria Bakery on the square's northeast corner.The park's 1897 statue of Ben Franklin is a non sequitur and the taps below his feet falsely advertise mineral water from Vichy, France. This puzzling public artwork was donated by certifiable SF eccentric Henry D Cogswell, who made his fortune fitting miners with gold fillings. Originally the monument was topped by Cogswell himself, but after it was mocked as ugly and toppled by self-appointed art critics in 1894, Ben Franklin was raised in the dentist's stead. Cogswell buried a time capsule under this monument in 1879, and in accordance with his instructions, a century later it was opened to reveal an early women's liberation manifesto, a San Francisco Chinese-language newspaper and sundry dental tools.	90	-122.409822	37.801065	5.0	16	34	12	0	0	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	san-francisco	Pier 39	The focal point of Fisherman's Wharf isn't the waning fishing fleet, but the carousel, carnival-like attractions, shops and restaurants of Pier 39 – and, of course, the famous sea lions.

On the plus side, its visitors center rents strollers, stores luggage, and has free phone-charging stations.The sea lions took over this coveted waterfront real estate in 1989 and these unkempt squatters have been making a public display ever since – canoodling, belching, scratching their backsides and gleefully shoving one another off the docks – becoming San Francisco's favorite mascots. And because California law requires boats to make way for marine mammals, yacht owners have had to relinquish valuable slips to accommodate the as many as 1300 sea lions that 'haul out' onto the docks between January and July.

usa	san-francisco	Palace Hotel	The city's most storied hotel dates back a century. Visit by day to see the opulent Garden Court's luminous stained-glass ceiling and Austrian-crystal chandeliers, then peek into the Pied Piper Bar to see Maxfield Parrish's mural of the Pied Piper. Afterward have drinks across the street at House of Shields and see the gorgeous mahogany back bar, which was originally intended to frame Parrish's mural but proved too small. In 2013, the Palace's present owner, Kyo-Ya Hotels, removed the Parrish mural to sell at auction but locals pitched a fit and management returned the painting to its proper place.The Palace opened in 1875 and was gutted during the 1906 earthquake and fire. Opera star Enrico Caruso was staying here that day and reportedly ran into the street, swearing he'd never return to San Francisco. The current building opened in 1909. Ten years later, Woodrow Wilson gave his League of Nations speech here and in 1923 US President Warren G Harding died upstairs. 		-122.402023	37.788408	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	san-francisco	Fort Funston	Grassy dunes up to 200ft high at Fort Funston give an idea what the Sunset looked like until the 20th century. A defunct military installation, Fort Funston still has 146-ton WWII guns aimed seaward and abandoned Nike missile silos near the parking lot. Nuclear missiles were never launched from Fort Funston, but flocks of hang gliders launch and land here.Butterflies and shorebirds have the run of Fort Funston, which is now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Loop trails and hang-glider launches are wheelchair- and stroller-accessible, and dogs are allowed off-leash in many areas. The National Park Service is gradually replacing invasive ice plants with native vegetation, and volunteers are welcome to join the effort at the Fort Funston Native Plant Nursery (see website for details). If you're driving, bicycling or walking here, follow the Great Hwy south and turn right on Skyline Blvd; park entrance is past Lake Merced, on the right-hand side.	90	-122.501914501	37.7148390746	5.5	59	19	1	3	0	4.5	[]	['Beaches', 'Outdoor Activities', 'Nature & Parks']	True	activity
usa	san-francisco	Masonic Auditorium	Conspiracy theorists, jazz aficionados and anyone exploring immigrant roots must know the Masonic Auditorium. Built as a temple to freemasonry in 1958, the building hosts headline acts and, every other Tuesday, mass US-citizenship swearing-in ceremonies. If you're looking for confirmation that California is run by a secret club, here you have it: many of the nation's founding fathers were Freemasons, including George Washington, and the same can be said about California's. It's all captured in the modernist stained-glass windows, which depict founders of freemasonry in California and their accomplishments – if you can decipher the enigmatic symbols and snippets of fabric embedded in the glass. The frieze below the windows has soil and gravel samples from all 58 California counties, plus Hawaii for some reason known only to those in on the secret handshake. Downstairs a visitors center reveals some of the society's intriguing secrets. 	90	-122.412675	37.791437	4.0	210	228	136	50	27	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	san-francisco	Contemporary Jewish Museum	That upended brushed-steel box balancing improbably on one corner isn't a sculpture, but a gallery for the Contemporary Jewish Museum, a major new SF landmark derived from a former power substation. Exhibits are thoughtfully curated, heavy-hitting and compelling, investigating ideas and ideals through the lens of artists and social figures as diverse as Andy Warhol, Gertrude Stein and Harry Houdini. The museum opened 2008 but had been around since 1984. Before Daniel Libeskind signed on to design New York's much-debated September 11 memorial, his design for this museum was already causing murmurs in SF, with its blue-steel cladding and shape drawn from the Hebrew word l'chaim – 'to life' – a fine idea in theory but one best appreciated from a helicopter. The steel structure is merged with the 1907 brick facade of the Jesse St power substation, an early industrial structure charmingly decorated with cherubs and garlands.	120	-122.403016	37.785733	3.5	30	40	19	9	8	3.5	[]	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity

Of note are the Savannah, featuring giraffes, zebras and ostrich, and the Lemur Forest, hosting cuddly Madagascan primates in a woodland setting.This is quite an improvement over a few years ago, when the elephant herd began dying of pneumonia and had to be relocated from the foggy Sunset to a more suitable climate. The zoo’s biggest attractions are the Great Ape Forest, the barnyard-style petting zoo and the gorgeous Dentzel carousel ($2 per ride). The Big Cat exhibit is now upgraded, after a 2007 tiger attack killed one person and injured two others. New interactive storybook features are activated with a Zoo Key ($3) and jeep strollers and wheelchairs are available for rent ($11 and $10, respectively).	90	-122.502150536	37.7324903642	5.0	152	163	93	26	14	4.0	[]	['Nature & Parks', 'Zoos & Aquariums', 'Outdoor Activities']	True	activity
usa	san-francisco	Union Square	Louis Vuitton is more top-of-mind than the Emancipation Proclamation, but Union Square – bordered by high-end department stores and boutiques – was named for pro-Union Civil War rallies held here 150 years ago.

Just beyond the square's northeast corner, on Stockton St, locate the Ruth Asawa Fountain – Asawa being one of SF's most esteemed artists – and note the relief's tiny detail of civic icons and SF landmarks. Each was fashioned from bread dough by 250 different people – from famous artists to little children – then cast by the artist in bronze. When in 2013, Apple Inc. submitted plans for its new store at Post and Stockton Sts, it assumed the fountain would be removed, but local outcry was so great, Apple was, at this writing, redrawing its plans. 		-122.407576	37.78781	5.0	390	499	191	34	11	4.0	['9:00 - 24:00', '33:00 - 48:00', '57:00 - 72:00', '81:00 - 96:00', '105:00 - 120:00', '129:00 - 144:00', '153:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 0:00']	['Specialty & Gift Shops', 'Shopping']	True	activity

usa	san-francisco	Old St Mary's Cathedral & Square	California's first cathedral was built in 1854 by an Irish entrepreneur determined to give wayward San Francisco some religion – despite its location on brothel-lined Dupont St. Hence the stern admonition on the clock tower: 'Son, observe the time and fly from evil.' The 1906 earthquake miraculously spared the church's brick walls but destroyed a bordello across the street, making room for St Mary's Square.Eventually the archdiocese abandoned attempts to convert Dupont St and handed the church over to America's first Chinese community mission, run by the activism-oriented Paulists. During WWII, Old St Mary's served 450,000 members of the US armed services as a recreation center and cafeteria.

Inside, nature is everywhere – in hewn-maple chairs, mighty madrone trees supporting the roof and in scenes of Northern California that took muralist William Keith 40 years to complete. Church founder Emanuel Swedenborg was an 18th-century Swedish theologian, scientist and occasional conversationalist with angels; he believed humans are spirits in a material world unified by nature, love and luminous intelligence – a lovely concept, embodied in an equally lovely building.

usa	san-francisco	Bob Kaufman Alley	What, you mean your hometown doesn’t have a street named after an African American Catholic-Jewish-voodoo anarchist Beat poet who refused to speak for 12 years? The man revered in France as the ‘American Rimbaud’ was a major poet who helped found the legendary Beatitudes magazine in 1959 and a spoken-word bebop jazz artist who was never at a loss for words, yet he felt compelled to take a Buddhist vow of silence after John F Kennedy’s assassination that he kept until the end of the Vietnam War. Kaufman’s life was hardly pure poetry: he was a teenage runaway, periodically found himself homeless, was occasionally jailed for picking fights in poetry with police, battled methamphetamine addiction with varying success and once claimed his goal was to be forgotten. Yet like the man himself, this hidden alleyway in his honor is offbeat, streetwise and often profoundly silent.		-122.407219	37.801408	None							[]	[]		activity

By the time he emerged bankrupt from San Quentin State Prison, the cupola was oxidizing green.Grammy-winning folk group The Kingston Trio bought the tower in the 1960s and the Grateful Dead recorded in the basement. Since the 1970s, Columbus Tower has been owned by Francis Ford Coppola, and film history has been made here by Coppola's American Zoetrope filmmaking studio, The Joy Luck Club director Wayne Wang and Academy Award–winning actor/director Sean Penn.

There's just one part-time resident: river otter Sutro Sam .Above the baths are the new Land's End Lookout visitor center and cafe plus the Sutro Heights Park public gardens, built in 1885 and restored with native plants. The path down to the baths is steep, but worth it at low tide to discover a hidden gem: a sea-cave tunnel that leads to end-of-the-world views of Marin Headlands.

On the plaque's extreme right is 'The Heathen Chinee.' It's not a racist attack – au contraire – but a reference to the eponymous 1870 satirical poem Harte wrote mocking anti-Chinese sentiment in Northern California.

A decade ago, less than 30 remained and nobody wanted the place, until the city offered tax breaks to entice Twitter to move here from its outgrown home in South Park. After a $1.2 million LEED-certified green makeover that included installing a rooftop farm, Twitter nested here. Too bad only employees can access the free video arcade and Birdfeeder cafeteria - but the new ground-floor public market offers 22,000 square feet of local gourmet fare, for a price. Tweeting about your lunch here seems uniquely appropriate. But consider what the emergency sign says upstairs: "In case of fire: exit building before tweeting about it."		-122.416813	37.776838	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	san-francisco	Haight St	Was it the fall of 1966 or the winter of ’67? As the Haight saying goes, if you can remember the Summer of Love, man, you probably weren’t there. The fog was laced with Nag Champa incense and burning draft cards, entire days were spent contemplating DayGlo Grateful Dead posters, and the corner of Haight and Ashbury Sts became the turning point of a generation.Flashbacks are a given in the Haight, which still has its swinging ’60s tendencies. Only a very mysterious, very local illness could explain the number of neighborhood medical marijuana clubs, and tie-dyes and ideals have never entirely gone out of fashion here – hence the highly prized vintage psychedelic rock tees on the wall at Wasteland and Bound Together Anarchist Book Collective .	90	-122.447771	37.769896	4.0	210	228	136	50	27	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Filmed rituals held in the tower by Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey apparently involved hundreds of candles and coaxing a grumpy lion up four flights of stairs.	90	-122.434293	37.775983	5.0	171	230	79	11	2	4.0	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks']	True	activity
usa	san-francisco	First Unitarian Church	Low-down and rough around the edges aren’t usually meant as compliments, and they’re not usually applied to a church. But George Percy’s down-to-earth 1888 design for a cathedral in rough-hewn stone was considered appropriate by the progressive Universalists, whose current church committees include a pagan interest group and gay marriage advocacy. The 1970–74 annex built by Callister Payne & Rosse is a modernist eye-catcher that’s conceptually consistent with the older structure: a low, concrete-slab building that makes no secret of its construction. The design for the annex owes an obvious debt to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Unity Temple in Oak Park, Illinois, as well as local Japanese influences appropriate to its location at the edge of Japantown.		-122.42288053	37.7852239695	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	san-francisco	Chinese Telephone Exchange	California's earliest adopters of advanced technology weren't in Silicon Valley but right here in Chinatown.

To connect callers, switchboard operators spoke fluent English and five Chinese dialects and memorized at least 1500 Chinatown residents by name, residence and occupation. Managers lived onsite and kept the switchboard operating 365 days a year.Since anyone born in China was prohibited by law from visiting San Francisco throughout the 1882–1943 Chinese Exclusion era, this switchboard was the main means of contact with family and business partners in China for 60 years. The exchange operated until 1949 and the landmark was bought and restored by Bank of Canton in 1960.		-122.4062611	37.79506749	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	san-francisco	Clarion Alley	Trial by fire is nothing compared to Clarion Alley's street-art test: unless a piece is truly inspired, it's going to get peed on or painted over. Very few pieces survive for years, such as Megan Wilson's daisy-covered Capitalism Is Over (If You Want It) or Jet Martinez' view of Clarion Alley inside a man standing in a psychedelic forest. Even art-prankster Banksy respected the rules of this road: instead of infringing on local turf curated by Balmy Alley's collective of street artists, Banksy's stencil of a Native American holding a No Trespassing sign went up in Sycamore St, the next alley over. Incontinent art critics seem to have taken over the east end of Balmy Alley – pee-eew! – so topical murals usually go up on the west end.	90	-122.4206	37.762968	5.5	28	12	4	2	0	4.5	[]	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
