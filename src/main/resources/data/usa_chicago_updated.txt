usa	chicago	Millennium Park	Rising boldly by the lakefront, Millennium Park is a treasure trove of free and arty sights. Frank Gehry's 120ft-high swooping silver band shell anchors what is, in essence, an outdoor modern design gallery. It includes Jaume Plensa's 50ft-high Crown Fountain , which projects video images of locals spitting water, gargoyle style; the Gehry-designed BP Bridge that spans Columbus Dr and offers great skyline views; and the McCormick Tribune Ice Rink that fills with skaters in winter (and alfresco diners in summer). The newest installment is the Nichols Bridgeway that arches from the park up to the Art Institute's 3rd-floor contemporary sculpture garden (free to view).However, the thing that has become the park's biggest draw is 'the Bean' – officially titled Cloud Gate – Anish Kapoor's ridiculously smooth, 110-ton, silver-drop sculpture. Locals and visitors alike find it hard to resist such playful art, as you'll see from all the folks splashing around in Crown Fountain and touching the sculpture.In summer, Millennium's acoustically awesome band shell – Pritzker Pavilion – hosts free concerts at lunchtime and at 6:30pm. For the latter, bring a picnic and bottle of wine and tune in to new music on Mondays, jazz and world music on Thursdays, and classical music on most other days. Each Saturday free exercise classes (yoga at 8am, Pilates at 9am and dance at 10am) take place on the Great Lawn. And the Family Fun Tent provides free kids' activities daily between 10am and 3pm. Free walking tours (Welcome Center; 11:30am and 1pm) take place daily, or do it yourself with a downloadable tour from the website.Technically, Millennium is part of the northwest corner of Grant Park.	90	-87.621857	41.882327	5.5	6722	2525	321	26	12	4.5	['6:00 - 23:00', '30:00 - 47:00', '54:00 - 71:00', '78:00 - 95:00', '102:00 - 119:00', '126:00 - 143:00', '150:00 - 167:00']	['Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Nature & Parks', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	chicago	Willis Tower	Yes, you're at the right place. Willis Tower was the Sears Tower until mid-2009, when insurance broker Willis Group Holdings bought the naming rights. No matter what you call it, it's still the USA's tallest building, and its 103rd-floor Skydeck puts visitors 1454 feet up in the clouds. Glass-floored ledges jut out in mid-air and give a knee-buckling perspective straight down. Enter via Jackson Blvd, then take the elevator down to the waiting area, where you go through security and pay admission. Queues can be up to an hour on busy days (peak times are in summer, between 11am to 4pm Friday through Sunday). There's a factoid-filled film to watch, and then the ear-popping, 70-second ride to the top. On clear days the view sweeps over four states.

usa	chicago	Famous Loop Architecture	Sure, there’s the Willis Tower. But it’s just one in a long line of high-flying buildings in Chicago. Ever since the city presented the world with the first skyscraper in 1885, it has thought big with its architecture and pushed the envelope of modern design. The Loop is ground zero for gawking.The following buildings represent the pioneering Chicago School style, stressing economy, simplicity and function. Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan were the era’s ideas men.Architecture buffs on a pilgrimage bow down first to the Monadnock Building , two buildings in one that depict a crucial juncture in skyscraper development. The north half is the older, traditional design from 1891 (with thick, load-bearing walls), while the south is the newer, mod half (with a metal frame that allows for jazzier-looking walls and bigger windows). See the difference?The 1888 Rookery looks hulking and fortresslike outside, but it’s light and airy inside thanks to Frank Lloyd Wright’s atrium overhaul. Step inside and have a look. Pigeons used to roost here, hence the name.Weep all you want over the old Marshall Field’s becoming Macy’s; the building remains a classic no matter who’s in it. The iconic bronze corner clocks on the outside have given busy Loop workers the time for over 100 years now. Inside, a 6000-sq-ft dome designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany caps the north-side atrium; 50 artists toiled for 18 months to make it. The best view is from Ladies’ Lingerie, on the 5th floor.Carson Pirie Scott & Co was originally criticized as being too ornamental to serve as a retail building. You be the judge, as you admire Louis Sullivan’s superb metalwork around the main entrance at State and Madison Sts. Though Sullivan insisted that ‘form follows function,’ it’s hard to see his theory at work in this lavishly flowing cast iron. Amid the flowing botanical and geometric forms, look for Sullivan’s initials, LHS. The century-old department store vacated the building in 2007, and it has become office space.The architects behind the Marquette Building made natural light and ventilation vital components. While that’s nice, the most impressive features are the sculptured panels and mosaics that recall the exploits of French explorer Jacques Marquette; look for them above the entrance and in the lobby (where there’s also a free little exhibit on Chicago School architecture).With its 16 stories of shimmering glass, framed by brilliant white terra-cotta details, the Reliance Building is a breath of fresh air. The structure’s lightweight internal metal frame – much of which was erected in only 15 days – supports a glass facade that gives it a feeling of lightness, a style that didn’t become universal until after WWII. Today the Reliance houses the chic Hotel Burnham. Added historical bonus: Al Capone’s dentist drilled teeth in what’s now room 809.Another terra-cotta beauty is the 1904 Santa Fe Building , where architect Daniel Burnham kept his offices. Enter the lobby and look up at the vast light well Burnham placed in the center – he gave this same feature to the Rookery. Appropriately enough, the Santa Fe Building now houses the Chicago Architecture Foundation.And last, but certainly not least, no discussion of famed Loop architecture is complete without mentioning the boxy, metal-and-glass International Style of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. His Kluczynski Building , part of the Chicago Federal Center , is a prime example; he designed many more buildings at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

usa	chicago	Bronzeville Historic Buildings	Once home to Louis Armstrong and other notables, Bronzeville thrived as the vibrant center of black life in the city from 1920 to 1950, boasting an economic and cultural strength akin to New York’s Harlem. Shifting populations, urban decay and the construction of a wall of public housing along State St led to Bronzeville’s decline. In the last decade it started its comeback. Many young urban professionals have moved back to the neighborhood, and South Loop development stretches almost all the way here. Still, be careful at night; it’s not a good place to be walking around after dark.Examples of stylish architecture from the past can be found throughout Bronzeville, but some of the buildings are in miserable shape and aren’t worthy of more than an inspection of the exterior. You can see some fine homes along two blocks of Calumet Ave between 31st and 33rd Sts, an area known as ‘the Gap.’ The buildings here include Frank Lloyd Wright’s only row houses, the Robert W Roloson Houses .One of scores of Romanesque houses that date from the 1880s, the Ida B Wells House is named for its 1920s resident. Wells was a crusading journalist who investigated lynchings and other racially motivated crimes. She coined the line: ‘Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.’Gospel music got its start at Pilgrim Baptist Church , originally built as a synagogue from 1890 to 1891. Unfortunately, the opulent structure burned to the ground (barring these few exterior walls) in 2006 when a roof repairman lost control of his blowtorch. Gospel fans can make a pilgrimage to two more places further south where the music still soars on Sunday. The Greater Salem Missionary Baptist Church is where gospel great Mahalia Jackson was a lifelong member. Still further south, modern Salem Baptist Church boasts one of the city’s top choral ensembles, and is helmed by the charismatic state senator Reverend James Meeks.The Supreme Life Building , a 1930s office building, was the spot where John H Johnson Jr, the publishing mogul who founded Ebony magazine, got the idea for his empire, which includes Jet and other important titles serving African Americans. There’s a little neighborhood visitors center that sells old albums and trinkets behind the bank here; enter from 35th St.In the median at 35th St and Martin Luther King Jr Dr, the Victory Monument was erected in 1928 in honor of the black soldiers who fought in WWI. The figures include a soldier, a mother and Columbia, the mythical figure meant to symbolize the New World.	90	None	None	4.0	9	7	5	0	0	4.0	[]	['Historic Walking Areas', 'Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Public Art	Chicago has commissioned several puzzling public artworks over the decades. The granddaddy is Pablo Picasso’s work, known to everyone as ‘the Picasso' The artist was 82 when the work was commissioned. The US Steel Works in Gary, Indiana, made it to Picasso’s specifications and erected it in 1967. When Chicago tried to pay Picasso for the work, he refused the money, saying the sculpture was meant as a gift to the city. At the time, many locals thought it was hideous and should be torn down and replaced with a statue of Cubs’ great Ernie Banks.Joan Miró’s work The Sun, the Moon and One Star , known now as Miró’s Chicago , is across the street from ’the Picasso.’ Miró hoped to evoke the ‘mystical force of a great earth mother’ with this 40ft sculpture, made of various metals, cement and tile in 1981.French sculptor Jean Dubuffet created Monument with Standing Beast , which everyone just calls ‘Snoopy in a Blender,’ at around the same time. The white fiberglass work looks a little like inflated puzzle pieces and has a definite Keith Haring feel to it. As you can see by the large number of kids crawling around inside, it’s definitely a hands-on piece of art.Russian-born artist Marc Chagall loved Chicago, and in 1974 he donated a grand mosaic called the Four Seasons to the city. Using thousands of bits of glass and stone, the artist portrayed six scenes of the city in hues reminiscent of the Mediterranean coast of France, where he kept his studio. Chagall continued to make further adjustments, such as updating the skyline, after the work arrived in Chicago.A few blocks south on Dearborn, Alexander Calder’s soaring red-pink sculpture Flamingo provides some much needed relief from the stark facades of the federal buildings around it. Calder dedicated the sculpture in October 1974 by riding into the Loop on a bandwagon pulled by 40 horses, accompanied by a circus parade.For the locations of more public artworks stashed around the city, pick up a copy of the highly useful Chicago Public Art Guide at any visitors center, or check the website www.cityofchicago.org/publicart.

usa	chicago	Astor Street	In 1882 Bertha and Potter Palmer were the power couple of Chicago. His web of businesses included the city’s best hotel and a huge general merchandise store that he later sold to a clerk named Marshall Field. When they later relocated north from Prairie Ave to a crenellated castle of a mansion at what is now 1350 N Lake Shore Dr, the Palmers set off a lemminglike rush of Chicago’s wealthy to the neighborhood around them. The mansions sitting along Astor St, especially the 1300 to 1500 blocks, reflect the grandeur of that heady period.While he was still working for Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright (who was 19 at the time) designed the large but only 11-room Charnley-Persky House , and proclaimed with his soon-to-be-trademarked bombast that it was the ‘first modern building.’ Why? Simply because it did away with Victorian gaudiness in favor of plain, abstract forms that went on to become the modern style. It was completed in 1892 and now houses the Society of Architectural Historians.The Cyrus McCormick Mansion is one of the neighborhood’s standouts. The 1893 neoclassical home was designed by New York architect Stanford White. McCormick and his family had the whole place to themselves, but it’s now divided up into condos. It’s still the high-rent district – a three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit goes for $1.75 million (washer and dryer included).The 1885 mansion that serves as the Archbishop’s Residence spans the entire block to Astor. This sweet crib, complete with 19 chimneys, is one of the many perks that comes with leading the Chicago Catholic Archdiocese. Seven archbishops have lived here, and world leaders from Franklin D Roosevelt to Pope John Paul II have crashed at the residence while in town.Don’t forgot to check out another special house in the ‘hood: Hugh Hefner’s first Playboy Mansion is nearby.		-87.6275753975	41.9084893113	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	chicago	Printer's Row	Chicago was a center for printing at the turn of the 20th century, and the rows of buildings on S Dearborn St from W Congress Pkwy south to W Polk St housed the heart of the city's publishing industry. By the 1970s the printers had left for more economical quarters elsewhere, and the buildings had been largely emptied out, some of them barely getting by on the feeble rents of obscure nonprofit groups.In the late 1970s savvy developers saw the potential in these derelicts, and one of the most successful gentrification projects in Chicago began. The following describes some of the notable buildings in the area as you travel from north to south.A snazzy renovation of the Mergenthaler Lofts , the 1886 headquarters for the legendary linotype company, included the artful preservation of a diner storefront. The Pontiac Building , a classic 1891 design by Holabird & Roche, features the same flowing masonry surfaces as the firm's Monadnock Building to the north.A massive and once-windowless wreck, the 1911 Transportation Building enjoyed a 1980 restoration that assured the neighborhood had arrived. The Second Franklin Building , a 1912 factory, shows the history of printing on its tiled facade. The roof slopes to allow for a huge skylight over the top floor where books were hand bound; this building existed long before fluorescent lights or high-intensity lamps. The large windows on many of the other buildings in the area served the same purpose.Once the Chicago terminal of the Santa Fe Railroad, the 1885 Dearborn St Station used to be the premier station for trains to and from California. Today it merely sees the trains of parent-propelled strollers from the Dearborn Park neighborhood, built on the site of the tracks to the south.	90	-87.629299	41.874751	4.0	6	1	4	2	0	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Humboldt Park	This 207-acre park, which lends its name to the surrounding neighborhood, comes out of nowhere and gobsmacks you with Mother Nature. A lagoon brushed by native plants takes up much of the green space, and birdsong flickers in the air. The 1907 Prairie School boathouse rises up from the lagoon’s edge and serves as the park’s showpiece. A gravel path takes off from the boathouse and circles the water, where you’ll sometimes see people fishing. Across the street, on the northwest corner of Humboldt Dr and Division St, lies the Formal Garden , rich with jelly-bean-colored flower beds and bison sculptures (by Edward Kemeys, the gent who hewed the Art Institute lions). It’s a fine place to sit and smell the roses. Just south, the Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Culture has cool free exhibits ongoing. The park was built in 1869 and named for German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. Landscape architect Jens Jensen gave it its 'prairie style' design, using native plants and stone, in the early 1900s. The park has gone through some rough times since then. It has only come into its own again in the past decade. While it’s family-filled by day, it’s still pretty rough and best avoided at night (unless there's a free outdoor movie or music event happening).Street vendors and food trucks sell fried plantains, meat dumplings and other Puerto Rican specialities around the park's edges. Many congregate on Kedzie Ave at North Ave and at Hirsch St – sniff them out for a picnic. The annual Riot Fest punk music bash takes over the park in mid-September.

usa	chicago	Water Tower	The 154ft-tall, turreted tower is a defining city icon: it was the sole downtown survivor of the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, along with the Pumping Station (aka Water Works), its associated building across the street. Today the tower houses the City Gallery , showcasing Chicago-themed works by local photographers.Built in 1869, the tower and pumping station were constructed with local yellow limestone in a Gothic style popular at the time. It's this stone and lack of flammable interiors that saved them when the fire roared through town.The Water Tower was the great hope of Chicago when it first opened, one part of a great technological breakthrough that was going to provide fresh, clean water for the city from intake cribs set far out in Lake Michigan. Before then, the city’s drinking water had come from shore-side collection basins that sucked in sewage-laden water and industrial runoff from the Chicago River. Garnished with the occasional school of small fish, it all ended up in the sinks and bathtubs of unhappy Chicago residents.Though the fish problem was solved by the new system, the plan was ultimately a failure. Sewage from the river, propelled by spring rains, made its way out to the new intake bins. The whole smelly situation didn’t abate until the Chicago River was reversed in the 1890s (when engineers used canals and locks to send sewage away from Lake Michigan). By 1906 the Water Tower was obsolete and only public outcry saved it from demolition three times. Whether Oscar Wilde would have joined the preservationists is debatable: when he visited Chicago in 1881 he called the Water Tower ‘a castellated monstrosity with salt and pepper boxes stuck all over it’. Restoration in 1962 ensured the tower’s survival. 		-87.624623	41.897064	5.5	162	149	55	2	0	4.5	['10:00 - 18:00', '34:00 - 45:00', '58:00 - 69:00', '82:00 - 93:00', '106:00 - 117:00', '130:00 - 141:00', '154:00 - 165:00']	['Shopping Malls', 'Shopping']	True	activity

Better yet, docents lead 90-minute tours (10am Monday to Friday, 10:30am Saturday and Sunday); departure is from the welcome center in the McCormick Tribune Campus Center. The center also rents audio tours (same price) from 10am to 3pm.A world-class leader in technology, industrial design and architecture, the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) owes much of its look to Mies van der Rohe, who fled the Nazis in Germany for Chicago in 1938. From 1940 until his retirement in 1958, Mies designed 22 IIT buildings that reflected his tenets of architecture, combining simple, black-metal frames with glass and brick infills. The look became known as the International Style. The star of the campus and Mies’ undisputed masterpiece is SR Crown Hall , appropriately home to the College of Architecture. The building, close to the center of campus, appears to be a transparent glass box floating between its translucent base and suspended roof. At night it glows from within like an illuminated jewel.Mies isn’t the only architectural hero whose works are on display at IIT. In 2003 the campus opened two other buzz-worthy buildings. Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas designed the McCormick Tribune Campus Center with its simple lines and striking en-tubing of the El tracks that run overhead. This is Koolhaas’ only building in the USA. Just south of the Campus Center is the Helmut Jahn–designed State Street Village . Jahn studied at IIT in his younger days, and his strip of rounded glass-and-steel residence halls is a natural progression from the works of the modernist bigwigs he learned from while here.		-87.626181	41.835629	None							[]	[]		activity
usa	chicago	University of Chicago	Faculty and students have racked up more than 80 Nobel prizes within U of C's hallowed halls. The campus is well worth a stroll, offering grand Gothic architecture and good free museums.The economics and physics departments lay claim to most of the awards. Merton Miller, a U of C economics faculty member and a Nobel winner himself, explained the string of wins to the Sun-Times : ‘It must be the water; it certainly can’t be the coffee.’The university’s classes first met on October 1, 1892. John D Rockefeller was a major contributor to the institution, donating more than $35 million, calling it ‘the best investment I ever made in my life.’ The original campus was constructed in an English Gothic style. Highlights of a walkabout include the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel , the exterior of which will send sculpture lovers into paroxysms of joy – the facade bears 24 life-sized religious figures and 53 smaller ones, with even more inside. Check the website for carillon and tower tours, and yoga and meditation classes. The William Rainey Harper Memorial Library is another must-see. The long row of arched, two-story windows bathes the 3rd-floor reading room with light and an almost medieval sense of calm. The Bond Chapel is equally serene. Built in 1926, the exquisite 300-seat chapel is the harmonious creation of the architects, sculptors, woodcarvers and glassmakers who worked together on the project.The university is also where the nuclear age began: Enrico Fermi and his Manhattan Project cronies built a reactor and carried out the world's first controlled atomic reaction on December 2, 1942.

usa	chicago	Bridgeport & Union Stockyards Gate	The community of Bridgeport is more noteworthy for its historical role than for tourism, though visitors may find themselves here for a White Sox game. The stockyards were once a major attraction, but they have long since closed and the land is being rapidly covered by new warehouses. Bridgeport is also the traditional home of Chicago’s Irish mayors (this is where the Daley dynasty grew up), and remains an enclave of descendants of Irish settlers.Halsted St, from 31st St south to 43rd St, is Bridgeport’s rather uninteresting main drag. Most of the neighborhood lies west of the huge train embankment that itself is west of US Cellular Field. However, Bridgeport extends north of the park all the way to Chinatown and makes for a good walk after a game if you’re in a group and don’t stray east of the Dan Ryan Expressway.A tiny vestige of the stockyards lies a block west of the 4100 block of S Halsted St. The Union Stockyards Gate was once the main entrance to the vast stockyards where millions of cows and almost as many hogs met their ends each year. During the 1893 World’s Expo the stockyards were a popular tourist draw, with nearly 10,000 people a day making the trek here to stare, awestruck, as the butchering machine took in animals and spat out blood and meat.The value of those slaughtered in 1910 was an enormous $225 million. While sanitary conditions eventually improved from the hideous levels documented by Upton Sinclair, during the Spanish-American war American soldiers suffered more casualties because of bad cans of meat from the Chicago packing houses than because of enemy fire.

The half-mile-long Nature Boardwalk circles the adjacent South Pond and teaches about wetlands ecology; keep an eye out for endangered birds such as the black-crowned night heron.The rest of the zoo is fairly typical. The exhibits for the lions and other big cats and for the sea lions are fine but unremarkable. Still, free is a good price, and if you come during the colder months you’ll have many of the animals to yourself.The zoo has multiple entrances around its perimeter. The Gateway Pavilion (on Cannon Dr) is the main one, where you can rent strollers, pick up a free map and see the schedule for the day’s feedings, training demonstrations and zookeeper talks. Drivers be warned: parking here is among the city’s worst. If you do find a spot in the Cannon Dr lot, it can cost up to $35 for four hours.	150	-87.6336211	41.92165445	4.5	1288	650	207	45	19	4.5	['10:00 - 17:00', '34:00 - 41:00', '58:00 - 65:00', '82:00 - 89:00', '106:00 - 113:00', '130:00 - 137:00', '154:00 - 161:00']	['Nature & Parks', 'Outdoor Activities', 'Zoos & Aquariums']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven	From 1957 to 1967, the humble building at 2120 S Michigan Ave was Chess Records, the seminal electric blues label. It's now called Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven Foundation, named for the bassist who wrote most of Chess's hits, and it's open for tours. Free blues concerts rock the side garden on summer Thursdays at 6pm. The Chess brothers, two Polish Jews, ran the recording studio that saw – and heard – the likes of Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Koko Taylor and others. Chuck Berry recorded four top-10 singles here, and the Rolling Stones named a song '2120 S Michigan Ave' after a recording session at this spot in 1964. (Rock trivia buffs will know that the Stones named themselves after the Muddy Waters song 'Rolling Stone.')But within a few decades, the building had fallen by the wayside and was on the chopping block until Dixon's family bought it. It opens for tours most days, and small groups of hard-core blues fans trickle in for the pilgrimage through the old offices and studios. It's pretty ramshackle, with few original artifacts on display. Still, when Willie's grandson hauls out the bluesman's well-worn standup bass and lets you take a pluck, it's pretty cool...  The hours can be erratic, so it's wise to call first to make sure someone is on site. There are two types of tour: the short one ($5, which is 25 minutes and our recommendation), and the long one ($10, which adds a 45-minute video to the mix).	90	-87.624122	41.853668	4.5	16	8	2	0	0	4.5	[]	['Historic Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Chinatown	Chinatown's charm is best enjoyed by going from bakery to bakery, nibbling chestnut cakes and almond cookies, then shopping for Hello Kitty trinkets and tea in the small shops. Old Chinatown stretches along Wentworth Ave south of Cermak, and is the neighborhood's traditional retail heart (and a good place to purchase a turtle). Chinatown Square , along Archer Ave north of Cermak, is the newer commerce district; it's filled with restaurants and is at its wonderful noisiest on weekends.When you're not stuffing your face, you can check out a couple of sights. Ping Tom Memorial Park , behind the square, offers dramatic city-railroad-bridge views. The On Leong Building stands out in old Chinatown. It once housed neighborhood service organizations and some illegal gambling operations that led to spectacular police raids. It now houses the Chinese Merchants Association. Built in 1928, the grand structure is a fantasy of Chinese architecture that makes good use of glazed terra-cotta details. Note how the lions guarding the door have twisted their heads so they don't have to risk bad luck by turning their backs to each other.On Saturdays and Sundays in summer, Chicago Water Taxi runs a groovy boat down the Chicago River from Michigan Ave (the dock is on the bridge's northwest side, by the Wrigley Building) to Ping Tom park. It costs $4 one way, and takes 25 minutes.	150	-87.63444185	41.85178194	3.5	55	112	73	38	17	3.5	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

It also contains the world's largest Tiffany stained-glass dome, Chicago's main Visitors Center and StoryCorps’ recording studio (where folks tell their tale, get a CD of it and have it preserved in the Library of Congress). All free!Foreign films screen on Wednesday at 6:30pm from May to September. StoryCorps operates on Thursday (2pm to 7pm) and Saturday (10am to 5pm). Check the daily schedule posted at the entrances (at both Randolph and Washington Sts) to see what else is going on.The exquisite, beaux-arts building began its life as the Chicago Public Library in 1897. The Gilded Age interior mixes white Carrara and green Connemara marble throughout. The gorgeous Tiffany dome is on the 3rd floor, where the library circulation desk used to be. The building's splendor was meant to inspire the rabble toward loftier goals. You can explore on your own, or take a free building tour (1:15pm Wednesday, Friday and Saturday), which departs from the Randolph St lobby.

usa	chicago	Churches of Ukrainian Village	The domes of the neighborhood’s majestic churches pop out over the treetops in Ukrainian Village. Take a minute to wander by St Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral , which is the less traditional of the neighborhood’s main churches. Its 13 domes represent Christ and the Apostles. The intricate mosaics – added to the 1915 building in 1988 – owe their inspiration to the Cathedral of St Sophia in Kiev. Saints Volodymyr & Olha Church was founded by traditionalists from St Nicholas, who broke away over liturgical differences and built this showy church in 1975. It makes up for its paucity of domes (only five) with a massive mosaic of the conversion of Grand Duke Vladimir of Kiev to Christianity in AD 988. Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral looks like it was scooped straight out of the Russian countryside and deposited in the neighborhood. But famed Chicago architect Louis Sullivan actually designed the 1903 beauty and its octagonal dome, front bell tower, and stucco and wood-framed exterior. Czar Nicholas II helped fund the structure, which is now a city landmark. Cathedral staff give tours of the gilded interior every Saturday from 11am to 4pm.	90	None	None	4.5	3	6	0	0	0	4.5	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Prairie Avenue Historic District	In the late 1800s, Prairie Ave between 16th and 20th Sts is where Chicago's millionaires lived in their mansions. Today the district is good for a stroll. Some of the homes have been preserved as museums; others are intriguing to admire from the outside. A footbridge over the train tracks links the area to Burnham Park and the Museum Campus.Prairie Ave was millionaire's row until the vice and industry of the nearby Levee District (four blocks west) got too close for comfort. By 1900 the crème de la crème had packed up and moved north to the Gold Coast. The neighborhood endured years of decline until the Chicago Architecture Foundation stepped in to help restore various buildings.Nifty ones to check out from the street (they're privately owned, so you can't go in) include the William K Kimball House , which dates from 1892 and is modeled after a 15th-century French château. Both it and the Romanesque Joseph G Coleman House now serve as the incongruous headquarters for the US Soccer Federation. Limestone puts a glitzy facade on the brick Elbridge G Keith House , an 1870 home.	90	-87.621471	41.857256	4.5	7	5	1	0	0	4.5	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Pilsen Galleries	Pilsen is the most casual of Chicago’s three main art districts (River North and West Loop are the other two). Works are largely by Chicago locals, and there’s a good deal of folk art. A great time to come here is on Second Fridays , when the 20 or so Pilsen galleries – known collectively as the Chicago Arts District – all stay open late on the second Friday of each month to welcome throngs of wandering art patrons with wine, snacks, and freshly hung paintings, ceramics and photos. It’s free, and takes place between 6pm and 10pm. Pick up a map at the office at 1821 S Halsted St.Regular gallery hours are erratic, though most are closed Sunday and Monday. For the part of Pilsen where the galleries are located, the number 8 Halsted St bus beats the Pink Line train.The following are some of the best bets in Pilsen: 4Art Inc , which specializes in large-scale group shows; Artpentry , urban art, with items like vintage luggage fashioned into speakers, usually only open during the art hop; and South Halsted Gallery , a husband and wife who display their cartoon-y paintings and drawings.	90	None	None	4.0	15	9	5	2	0	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

Most of the notable tombs lie around the lake, in the northern half of the 121 acres. Pick up a map at the entrance to navigate the swirl of streets.Many of the memorials relate to the lives of the dead in symbolic and touching ways: National League founder William Hulbert lies under a baseball; hotelier Dexter Graves lies under a work titled Eternal Silence; and George Pullman, the railroad car magnate who sparked so much labor unrest, lies under a hidden fortress designed to prevent angry union members from digging him up.Daniel Burnham, who did so much to design Chicago, gets his own island. Photographer Richard Nickel, who helped form Chicago’s budding preservation movement and was killed during the demolition of his beloved Chicago Stock Exchange Building, has a stone designed by admiring architects.

usa	chicago	River North Galleries	The River North district is the most established of Chicago’s three gallery-rich zones (West Loop and Pilsen are the other two), with art from top international names and price tags to match. It claims to be the largest concentration of private galleries in the US outside Manhattan. Most are very welcoming, and together they open their doors for a festive art hop on the first Thursday of every month (which is held in conjunction with the younger, edgier West Loop galleries). Pick up a gallery map at any of the venues to help find artwork to your liking.Some of our favorites: Catherine Edelman Gallery , where primarily photographic artworks range from traditional landscapes to mixed-media photo-based collages; Jean Albano Gallery , whose contemporary art includes paintings, drawings and interesting textile works; and Zolla-Lieberman Gallery , the first gallery to arrive in River North back in the ‘70s (when the area looked more like the West Loop does today), showing cool, contemporary art by established and emerging artists.	120	None	None	1.5	0	0	0	1	1	1.5	[]	['Art Galleries', 'Museums', 'Shopping']	False	activity
usa	chicago	Riverwalk	Clasping the Chicago River’s south side along Wacker Dr, this mile-long promenade provides a peaceful spot to take a break from downtown's hullabaloo. Access it from the stairs at any bridge. Outdoor cafes and bike and kayak rental shops dot the way and there's also a Vietnam veteran’s memorial (near N Wabash Ave), a small river history museum (at N Michigan Ave) and sightseeing boats sprinkled in.To the east, between Columbus and Lake Shore Drs on the river’s north side, Centennial Fountain shoots a massive arc of water across the river. It spurts for 10 minutes straight every hour on the hour, from 10am to 2pm and again from 5pm to midnight. The exercise is meant to commemorate the labor-intensive reversal of the Chicago River in 1900, which tidily began sending all of the city’s wastes downriver rather than into the lake. (Chicago’s neighbors downstate, as you can imagine, do not go out of their way to celebrate this feat of civil engineering). The Riverwalk is slated to expand west to Lake St over the next few years. 	90	-87.624604	41.888461	5.5	89	64	10	1	1	4.5	[]	['Historic Walking Areas', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	chicago	Holy Name Cathedral	Holy Name Cathedral is the seat of Chicago’s Catholic Church and where its powerful cardinals do their preaching. It provides a quiet place for contemplation, unless the excellent choirs are practicing, in which case it’s an entertaining respite. Check out the sanctuary’s ceiling while you’re inside. The hanging red hats are for Holy Name’s deceased cardinals; the hats remain until they turn to dust.Built in 1875 to a design by the unheralded Patrick Keely, the cathedral has been remodeled several times, most recently after a fire in 2009. Thus the bullet holes from a Capone-era hit outside the church are no longer visible. Actually, a couple of gangland killings took place near here. In 1924, North Side boss Dion O’Banion was gunned down in his florist shop (738 N State St) after he crossed Al Capone. In 1926, his successor, Hymie Weiss, died en route to the cathedral in a hail of bullets that came from the window at 740 N State St.The cathedral is open most of the day and holds frequent services. 	90	-87.627831	41.895878	5.5	391	123	24	4	1	4.5	[]	['Architectural Buildings', 'Religious Sites', 'Sights & Landmarks']	True	activity
usa	chicago	Newberry Library	The Newberry's public galleries are for bibliophiles: those who swoon over original Thomas Paine pamphlets about the French Revolution, or get weak-kneed seeing Thomas Jefferson's copy of the History of the Expedition under Captains Lewis and Clark (with margin notes!). Exhibits rotate yellowed manuscripts and tattered first editions from the library's extensive collection. The library itself, stacked with books, maps, photographs and other humanities-related materials, is on the upper floors. Those trying to research far-flung branches of their family tree will have a field day here. Entry requires a library card, but one-day passes are available for curious browsers. Once inside, you can pester the patient librarians with requests for help in tracking down all manner of historical ephemera. (The collection is noncirculating, though, so don’t expect to take that 1st edition of the King James Bible home with you.)

usa	chicago	Northerly Island	Northerly Island was once the busy commuter airport known as Meigs Field. Now it's a prairie-grassed park with walking trails, fishing, bird-watching and an outdoor concert venue. The shift from runway to willowy grasses has its root in a controversial incident that reads a little like a municipal spy thriller, complete with midnight operatives and surprise bulldozings. To sum it up: Mayor Richard M Daley wanted the land for a park; businesses wanted to keep it for their private planes. A standoff ensued. Then, one dark night in March 2003, Daley fired up the heavy machinery and razed the airfield while the city slept. His reasoning? Terrorists could attack Chicago with tiny planes launched from Meigs; the airfield was a security liability. Why it couldn't be jackhammered during daylight hours was never answered. But by 2005 the controversy had died down, and Chicagoans were out in force, happily exploring this beautiful piece of lakefront that had been off-limits for a half-century.	90	-87.608434	41.858974	3.0	16	13	10	5	24	3.0	['6:00 - 23:00', '30:00 - 47:00', '54:00 - 71:00', '78:00 - 95:00', '102:00 - 119:00', '126:00 - 143:00', '150:00 - 167:00']	['Islands', 'Nature & Parks']	False	activity
usa	chicago	National Museum of Mexican Art	Founded in 1982, this vibrant museum – the largest Latino arts institution in the USA – has become one of the city’s best. The vivid permanent collection sums up 1000 years of Mexican art and culture through classical paintings, shining gold altars, skeleton-rich folk art, beadwork and much more. Don't miss the psychedelic 'semen-acrylic' painting (that's, um, bodily fluids mixed with pigments). The turbulent politics and revolutionary leaders of Mexican history are well represented, including works about Cesar Chavez and Emiliano Zapata. The museum also sponsors readings by top authors and performances by musicians and artists. If you are in town during the fall, be sure to check out the exhibits and celebrations relating to November 1, the Day of the Dead, a traditional Mexican holiday that combines the festive with the religious.

Many historic buildings are nearby. Across the street, the Kehilath Anshe Ma’ariv-Isaiah Israel Temple is a domed masterpiece in the Byzantine style with acoustics that are said to be perfect. The house at 4944 S Woodlawn Ave was once home to Muhammad Ali, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan currently lives in the 1971 Elijah Muhammad House . Returning south, back toward Hyde Park, you can visit Obama’s barber Zariff and the bulletproof-glass-encased presidential barber chair at the Hyde Park Hair Salon .InstaGreeter offers free 60-minute walking tours of the neighborhood from the Hyde Park Art Center between 10am and 3pm on Saturdays in summer.

It got its latest UFO-landing-upon-a-Greek-ruin look in a controversial 2003 makeover. The Bears now play football here. Stadium tours are available; advance booking is required by phone or online.Before the 2003 renovation, Soldier Field's architecture was so noteworthy it was named a National Historic Landmark. Unfortunately, the landmark lacked corporate skyboxes and giant bathrooms, so the city (the venue is owned by the park district) decided it was time for a change. The new look met almost unanimous derision when it was unveiled; critics quickly dubbed it 'the Mistake on the Lake.'

usa	chicago	Original Playboy Mansion	The sexual revolution pretty much started in the basement ‘grotto’ of this 1899 mansion. Chicago magazine impresario Hugh Hefner bought it in 1959 and dubbed it the first Playboy Mansion, even hanging a brass plate over the door warning ‘If You Don’t Swing, Don’t Ring’. Alas, Chicago became too square for Hef by the mid ‘70s, so he split and built a new Playboy Mansion in LA.And that's where he remains today, in his pajamas. After he left, he donated the State St building to the School of the Art Institute for a dorm (imagine the pick-up lines!). It was gutted in 1993 and turned into four very respectable, very expensive condos. Hef's company, Playboy Enterprises, stayed headquartered in Chicago until 2012, and then it too moved west.

Clarence Darrow and Carl Sandburg are among the respected speakers who climbed up and shouted. In the 1970s, when it was a gathering place for young male prostitutes, it gained tragic infamy as the preferred pick-up spot of mass murderer John Wayne Gacy. Gacy took his victims back to his suburban home, where he killed them and buried their bodies in the basement. Convicted on 33 counts of murder (although the actual tally may be higher), he was executed in 1994.Today the square bears little trace of its past lives – except for one weekend a year in late July.

usa	chicago	Essanay Studios	Back before the talkies made silent film obsolete, Chicago reigned supreme as the number one producer of movie magic in the USA.

Essanay’s terra-cotta Indian head logo remains above the door at 1345 Argyle.These days, the building belongs to a local college. Essanay folded in 1917, about the time that many of its actors were being lured to the bright lights of a still-nascent Hollywood. If you see any of the early Essanay films, you'll notice local children performing unintentional cameos, and bits of familiar neighborhoods poking into the edge of 'Caifornia' mesas.

usa	chicago	Pilsen Churches	Some wonderful European-influenced churches remain throughout Pilsen. The 1914 St Adalbert Church features 185ft steeples and is a good example of the soaring religious structures built by Chicago’s ethnic populations through thousands of small donations from parishioners, who would cut family budgets to the bone to make their weekly contribution. The rich ornamentation in the interior of this Catholic church glorifies Polish saints and religious figures. The Poles had St Adalbert’s; the Irish had St Pius , a Romanesque revival edifice built between 1885 and 1892. Its smooth masonry contrasts with the rough stones of its contemporaries. Catholics of one ethnic group never attended the churches of the others, which explains why this part of town, with its concentration of Catholic immigrants, is thick with steeples.	90	None	None	4.0	15	9	5	2	0	4.0	[]	['Neighborhoods', 'Sights & Landmarks']	False	activity

It's a fine opportunity to learn about the Poles who helped shape Chicago, which has one of the world's largest Polish communities. (Casimir Pulaski, by the way, was a Polish hero in the American Revolution who was known as the ‘father of the American cavalry’ and the guy who saved George Washington’s life at the Battle of Brandywine; a pierogi , meanwhile, is a Polish dumpling.) 	120	-87.660997	41.899558	3.5	1	10	3	1	0	3.5	['11:00 - 16:00', '35:00 - 40:00', '59:00 - 64:00', '83:00 - 88:00', '131:00 - 136:00', '155:00 - 160:00']	['Specialty Museums', 'Museums']	False	activity

Designer Jens Jensen intended for the palms, ferns and other plants to recreate Chicago’s prehistoric landscape. Today the effect continues – all that’s missing is a rampaging stegosaurus.

During the 1893 World’s Expo the stockyards were a popular tourist draw, with nearly 10,000 people a day making the trek here to stare, awestruck, as the butchering machine took in animals and spat out blood and meat.The value of those slaughtered in 1910 was an enormous $225 million. While sanitary conditions eventually improved from the hideous levels documented by Upton Sinclair; during the Spanish-American war American soldiers suffered more casualties because of bad cans of meat from the Chicago packing houses than because of enemy fire.

For a main event, order one of the paellas ($11 to $13 per person, minimum two people) as soon as you get seated – they take a while to prepare.		-87.648883	41.919491	5.5	237	122	34	11	5	4.5	['9:00 - 22:00', '40:00 - 46:00', '64:00 - 70:00', '88:00 - 94:00', '112:00 - 118:00', '131:30 - 144:00', '153:00 - 168:00', '0:00 - 0:00']	[]	True	restaurant

If you want a slice of heaven, order the ‘special’, a stuffed pie containing sausage, mushroom, green pepper and onions.
