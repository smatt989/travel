Willis Tower	usa	chicago	activity	It's Chicago's tallest building, and the 103rd-floor Skydeck puts you high into the heavens. Take the ear-popping, 70-second elevator ride to the top, then step onto one of the glass-floored ledges jutting out in mid-air for a knee-buckling perspective straight down. On clear days the view sweeps over four states. The entrance is on Jackson Blvd. Queues can be up to an hour on busy days (peak times are in summer, between 11am and 4pm Friday through Sunday).	A bit of history: it was the Sears Tower until insurance broker Willis Group Holdings bought the naming rights in 2009.	9am-10pm Apr-Sep, 10am-8pm Oct-Mar	['9:00 - 22:00', '33:00 - 46:00', '57:00 - 70:00', '81:00 - 94:00', '105:00 - 118:00', '129:00 - 142:00', '153:00 - 166:00']	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/65d65c90412aafdc4e6d96dd932853e5-willis-tower.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.theskydeck.com	True	False	90	adult/child $22/14	['Tower']	['Architectural Buildings', 'Observation Decks & Towers', 'Sights & Landmarks']	-87.63589	41.878556	6.5	4.5	['4194', '2663', '933', '217', '124']	233 S Wacker Dr	233 S.

Ninety-minute tours ($25) of the iconic, ivy-clad ballpark are available April through September. The area around the facility is getting a makeover with spiffed-up amenities for visitors.

The museum's galleries hold some 20 million artifacts, tended by a slew of PhD–wielding scientists, as the Field remains an active research institution.After communing with Sue, dino lovers should head up to the 'Evolving Planet' exhibit on the second floor, which has more of the big guys and gals. You can learn about the evolution of the species and watch staff paleontologists clean up fossils in the lab.'Inside Ancient Egypt' is another good exhibit that recreates an Egyptian burial chamber on two levels. The mastaba (tomb) contains 23 actual mummies and is a reconstruction of the one built for Unis-ankh, the son of the last pharaoh of the Fifth dynasty, who died at age 21 in 2407 BC. The relic-strewn bottom level is especially worthwhile.Other displays that merit your time include the Hall of Gems and its glittering garnets, opals, pearls and deep-blue tanzanite stones (1000 times rarer than diamonds, which you'll also see plenty of). The Northwest Coast and Arctic Peoples totem pole collection got its start with artifacts shipped to Chicago for the 1893 World's Expo.

Essanay’s terra-cotta Indian head logo remains above the door at 1345 Argyle.	These days, the building belongs to a local college.

Washington Square	usa	chicago	activity	This plain-looking park across from the Newberry Library has quite a history.

(Many supposedly lived in nearby 'bughouses' – cheap hotels – hence the nickname.) Clarence Darrow and Carl Sandburg are among the respected speakers who climbed up and shouted.	In the 1970s, when Washington Sq was a gathering place for young male prostitutes, it gained tragic infamy as the preferred pick-up spot of mass murderer John Wayne Gacy. Gacy took his victims back to his suburban home, where he killed them and buried their bodies in the basement. Convicted on 33 counts of murder (although the actual tally may be higher), he was executed in 1994.Today the square bears little trace of its past lives – except for one weekend a year in late July.

Alas, Dillinger was a notorious bank robber and the FBI’s very first ‘Public Enemy Number One’. Sage also had troubles with the law and was about to be deported. To avoid it, she agreed to set up Dillinger. The venue now hosts plays by the Victory Gardens Theater.

It's a fine opportunity to learn about the Poles who helped shape Chicago, which has one of the world's largest Polish communities.

Nelson Algren's House	usa	chicago	activity	You can’t go inside, but on the 3rd floor of this apartment building writer Nelson Algren created some of his greatest works about life in the once down-and-out neighborhood.

Other insights Algren picked up in the 'hood: ‘Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom’s. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own’ – classic advice he relayed in A Walk on the Wild Side. His short Chicago: City on the Make summarizes 120 years of thorny local history and is the definitive read on the city’s character.

Humboldt Park	usa	chicago	activity	This 207-acre park, which lends its name to the surrounding neighborhood, comes out of nowhere and gobsmacks you with Mother Nature. A lagoon brushed by native plants takes up much of the green space, and birdsong flickers in the air. The 1907 Prairie School boathouse is the park’s centerpiece, home to a cafe and free cultural events. The flowery Formal Garden, the National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts  Culture, and Chicago's only inland beach are other highlights.	The park was built in 1869 and named for German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. Landscape architect Jens Jensen gave it its 'prairie style' design, using native plants and stone, in the early 1900s. The park has gone through some rough times since then, and has only come into its own again in the past decade. While it’s family-filled by day, it’s still pretty rough and best avoided at night (unless there's a free outdoor movie or music event happening).Street vendors and food trucks sell fried plantains, meat dumplings and other Puerto Rican specialties around the park's edges. Many congregate on Kedzie Ave at North Ave and at Hirsch St – sniff them out for a picnic.For more in-depth explorations, including the park's wee waterfall, wind turbine and picnic island, download the free audio tour at www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/audio-tours/humboldt-park.	6am-11pm	[]	lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/547883f0c4a7a29ff3c3df5516f43579-humboldt-park.jpg?auto=enhance&w=770&h=430&fit=crop	http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com	False	False	90		['Park']	['Nature & Parks']	-87.703073	41.905621	4.0	4.0	['6', '4', '4', '0', '0']	1440 N Humboldt Dr	1400 N Sacramento Ave, Chicago, 60622-2799	False	227		[]

Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven	usa	chicago	activity	From 1957 to 1967, this humble building was Chess Records, the seminal electric blues label. It's now named for the bassist who wrote most of Chess' hits. Staff give hour-long tours of the premises. It's pretty ramshackle, with few original artifacts on display. Still, when Willie's grandson hauls out the bluesman's well-worn stand-up bass and lets you take a pluck, it's pretty cool. Free blues concerts rock the side garden on summer Thursdays at 6pm.	The Chess brothers, two Polish Jews, ran the recording studio that saw – and heard – the likes of Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Koko Taylor and others. Chuck Berry recorded four top-10 singles here, and the Rolling Stones named a song '2120 South Michigan Avenue' after a recording session at this spot in 1964.

Northerly Island	usa	chicago	activity	This hilly, prairie-grassed park has walking and cycling trails, fishing, bird-watching and an outdoor venue for big-name concerts. It's actually a peninsula, not an island, but the Chicago skyline views are tremendous no matter what you call it. Stop in at the field house, if it's open, for tour information. Bicycles are available at the Divvy bike-share station by the Adler Planetarium.	Northerly Island was once the busy commuter airport known as Meigs Field. The shift from runway to willowy grasses has its root in a controversial incident that reads a little like a municipal spy thriller, complete with midnight operatives and surprise bulldozings. To sum it up: Mayor Richard M Daley wanted the land for a park; businesses wanted to keep it for their private planes. A standoff ensued. Then, one dark night in March 2003, Daley fired up the heavy machinery and razed the airfield while the city slept. His reasoning? Terrorists could attack Chicago with tiny planes launched from Meigs; the airfield was a security liability. Why it couldn't be jackhammered during daylight hours was never answered.

Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile	usa	chicago	hotel	The Sofitel looks a little like some state-of-the-art Apple computing device from the outside, its triangular glass tower leaning gracefully forward into space. Inside, stylish staff members tend to stylish 30- and 40-something guests, including many Europeans, who appreciate the minimalist vibe and sizable rooms (think blond wood and rectangular lines).

Central Loop Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	The Central Loop is in a good location (the name doesn’t lie) and has good prices if you’re stuck paying rack rates. It’s accessorized for business-oriented guests, though not so useful for families given the smallish size of the rooms. A fine pub pours drinks downstairs.

The Drake	usa	chicago	hotel	Queen Elizabeth, Dean Martin, Princess Di…the Reagans, the Bushes, the Clintons… Who hasn’t stayed at the elegant Drake Hotel since it opened in 1920? The chandelier-strewn grande dame commands a terrific location at the north end of Michigan Ave, near Oak St Beach. While the public spaces are gilded eyepoppers, the rooms are more everyday (though well-sized and comfy).	North-facing rooms have awesome lake views; they're worth the extra cost. Guests tend to be older or members of the many weddings the Drake hosts. Wi-fi costs $13 per day.

Raffaello Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	If only you could live in the creamy, silk-draped modernity of these rooms. Oh, wait, you can – they’re condominiums, too. Suites have microwaves and minifridges in marble cooking centers, plus roomy seating areas or separate living rooms. King and double rooms are smaller, but they have similar upscale amenities, such as rainforest shower heads and high-thread-count linens. Free wi-fi.

Swissotel Chicago	usa	chicago	hotel	Water vistas are just part of the attraction at this triangular-shaped, mirrored-glass high-rise at the confluence of river and lake. Business folk like the rooms' ample, well-appointed workstations. Families love the oversized layouts, separate shower and tub, and special kids’ suites with colorful furnishings and toys. The hotel shows up a lot on discount booking sites. Summer weekends sell out fast.	The fitness center with indoor pool is a fine perk. Wi-fi costs $15 per day.

Hotel Felix	usa	chicago	hotel	The 225-room, 12-story Felix is downtown’s first hotel to earn ecofriendly LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design; silver status, to be exact). The earth-toned, mod-furnished rooms are small but efficiently and comfortably designed. It’s more of a place for urban hipsters than families, but who doesn’t enjoy soft Egyptian-cotton sheets, free wi-fi and a wine-soaked French cafe on-site?

Each floor lays out its own sumptuous spread of pastries, fruit and yogurt every morning. In the evening you can munch free hors d'oeuvres and sip two free cocktails in the lounge. Rooms have 42in HDTVs with loads of channels and a small work desk. Wi-fi is free.	The swell location puts you near the river, Michigan Ave shopping and House of Blues.

Wrigley Hostel	usa	chicago	hotel	This unobtrusive hostel, located in a converted brick apartment block, is practically within home-run distance of Wrigley Field (and its rowdy nightlife). The blue-and-green-painted dorms come in co-ed or women-only configurations with four to 10 beds. Small private rooms are also available. Bathrooms, some with vintage claw-foot tubs, are shared on each floor. There's free breakfast (pancakes and fruit) and free, strong-signaled wi-fi property-wide.	The common room rocks a pool table, leather couches, bar stools and a sound system into which you can hook your iPod. The hostel also organizes trips to local blues and honky-tonk clubs.

Best Western Grant Park Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	This very basic Best Western attracts for its location near the Museum Campus.

Chicago Getaway Hostel	usa	chicago	hotel	The fun, social Getaway Hostel attracts mostly a 20-something-age crowd who strum the house guitars, lounge on leather couches, sip beer on the patio and head out to nightlife-rich Clark and Halsted Sts (the hostel is equidistant between the two). Staff organizes outings, such as pub crawls, throughout the week. Continental breakfast and wi-fi are free.	Rooms have a fresh, bright-hued coat of paint.

Aloft Chicago City Center	usa	chicago	hotel	This relatively new Aloft offers the chain’s typical compact, efficiently designed, minimalist rooms. They sport a bookish, library look here, with big windows and all the electronics you need. The clubby, game-filled lobby (another Aloft staple) is prime for mingling. So is Beatrix, a popular comfort-food restaurant and bakery that's on-site. Wi-fi is free.

Freehand Chicago	usa	chicago	hotel	This is an outpost of Miami's super-hip hostel-hotel hybrid. Rooms are small but stylish, finished with warm woods, bright tiles and Central American–tinged fabrics. Travelers are split evenly between the private rooms and eight-person, bunk-bed dorms (way spiffier than in most hostels, with privacy curtains around each bed). Everyone mingles in the shaggy, totem-pole-filled common area and in the on-site Broken Shaker bar.	No surprise: the Freehand sits in the thick of trendy shops, eateries and nightlife venues.

The Willows Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	Small and stylish, the Willows wins an architectural gold star. The chic little lobby provides a swell refuge of overstuffed chairs by the fireplace, while the 55 rooms, done up in shades of peach and soft green, evoke a 19th-century French countryside feel. Continental breakfast is included. It's well located near loads of casual restaurants, bars and shops, as well as the lakefront parklands.

Wicker Park Inn	usa	chicago	hotel	This classic brick row house is steps away from rockin’ restaurants and nightlife. The sunny rooms aren’t huge, but all have hardwood floors, soothing pastel color schemes and small desk spaces where you can use the free wi-fi. Breakfast is rich in baked goods and fruit.

City Suites Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	The mod, art-deco-tinged rooms and lobby buzzing just off Belmont Ave are vaguely reminiscent of a European city hotel. The El races right by the building, so light sleepers should ask for a room away from the tracks. Perks include free wi-fi throughout, free continental breakfast and a pass to a nearby fitness club.	Compared with the Majestic and Willows, the owners’ other two properties nearby, the City Suites skews toward a bit of a younger and livelier crowd.

Urban Holiday Lofts	usa	chicago	hotel	An international crowd fills the mix of dorms (with four to eight beds) and private rooms in this building of converted loft condos. Exposed-brick walls, hardwood floors and bunks with plump bedding feature in all 25 rooms. It's close to the El train station and in the thick of Wicker Park's nightlife. Continental breakfast is included.	The common room bustles with folks using the kitchen facilities, shooting pool and playing arcade games. Loads of bars and cafes beckon in the surrounding blocks.

Majestic Hotel	usa	chicago	hotel	Nestled into a row of residential housing, the Majestic is walking distance to Wrigley Field, Boystown and the lakefront. From the lobby fireplace and dark-wood furnishings to the handsome, paisley-swirled decor, the interior has the cozy feel of an English manor. Free wi-fi and continental breakfast are included.

Chicago Parthenon Hostel	usa	chicago	hotel	Guests young and old check in to this hostel that sits next to the Parthenon Restaurant in Greektown. It's a bit more out of the way and basic than other Chicago hostels; then again, prices are usually lower. Tidy dorms and private rooms come in myriad configurations; the typical single-sex dorm has eight beds with the bathroom down the hall.	There's not much in the way of common areas (though renovations are on the horizon). The free continental breakfast is a nice start to the day. Dorm dwellers must pay $2 extra for towels. Wi-fi is free but spotty.		[]			False	False		dm/r from $30/62	['hostel']	[]	-87.6473070681	41.8774988036	3.5	3.5	[]	310 South Halsted Street	310 S Halsted St, Chicago, 60661-5406	False	17		[]
